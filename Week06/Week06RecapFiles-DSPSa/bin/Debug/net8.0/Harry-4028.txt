2 CHAPTER ONE 
3 
4 THE BOY WHO LIVED 
5 
6 Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were the last people you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just didn't hold with such nonsense. 
7 
8 Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbors. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere. 
9 
10 The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn't think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs. Potter was Mrs. Dursley's sister, but they hadn't met for several years; in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended she didn't have a sister, because her sister and her good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street. The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but they had never even seen him. This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they didn't want Dudley mixing with a child like that. 
11 
12 When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday our story starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country. Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work, and Mrs. Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair. 
13 
14 None of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past the window. 
15 
16 At half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs. Dursley on the cheek, and tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed, because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls. "Little tyke," chortled Mr. Dursley as he left the house. He got into his car and backed out of number four's drive. 
17 
18 It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar -- a cat reading a map. For a second, Mr. Dursley didn't realize what he had seen -- then he jerked his head around to look again. There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn't a map in sight. What could he have been thinking of? It must have been a trick of the light. Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive -- no, looking at the sign; cats couldn't read maps or signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind. As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day. 
19 
20 But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something else. As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he couldn't help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about. People in cloaks. Mr. Dursley couldn't bear people who dressed in funny clothes -- the getups you saw on young people! He supposed this was some stupid new fashion. He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by. They were whispering excitedly together. Mr. Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren't young at all; why, that man had to be older than he was, and wearing an emerald-green cloak! The nerve of him! But then it struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt -- these people were obviously collecting for something... 
21 
22 yes, that would be it. The traffic moved on and a few minutes later, Mr. Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills. 
23 
24 Mr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor. If he hadn't, he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning. He didn't see the owls swoop ing past in broad daylight, though people down in the street did; they pointed and gazed open- mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead. Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime. Mr. Dursley, however, had a perfectly normal, owl-free morning. He yelled at five different people. He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more. He was in a very good mood until lunchtime, when he thought he'd stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery. 
25 
26 He'd forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the baker's. He eyed them angrily as he passed. He didn't know why, but they made him uneasy. This bunch were whispering excitedly, too, and he couldn't see a single collecting tin. It was on his way back past them, clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that he caught a few words of what they were saying. 
27 
28 "The Potters, that's right, that's what I heard yes, their son, Harry" 
29 
30 Mr. Dursley stopped dead. Fear flooded him. He looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them, but thought better of it. 
31 
32 He dashed back across the road, hurried up to his office, snapped at his secretary not to disturb him, seized his telephone, and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind. He put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache, thinking... no, he was being stupid. Potter wasn't such an unusual name. He was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry. Come to think of it, he wasn't even sure his nephew was called Harry. He'd never even seen the boy. It might have been Harvey. Or Harold. There was no point in worrying Mrs. Dursley; she always got so upset at any mention of her sister. He didn't blame her -- if he'd had a sister like that... but all the same, those people in cloaks... 
33 
34 He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at five o'clock, he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door. 
35 
36 "Sorry," he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell. It was a few seconds before Mr. Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak. He didn't seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground. On the contrary, his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare, "Don't be sorry, my dear sir, for nothing could upset me today! Rejoice, for You-Know-Who has gone at last! Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating, this happy, happy day!" 
37 
38 And the old man hugged Mr. Dursley around the middle and walked off. 
39 
40 Mr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been hugged by a complete stranger. He also thought he had been called a Muggle, whatever that was. He was rattled. He hurried to his car and set off for home, hoping he was imagining things, which he had never hoped before, because he didn't approve of imagination. 
41 
42 As he pulled into the driveway of number four, the first thing he saw -- and it didn't improve his mood -- was the tabby cat he'd spotted that morning. It was now sitting on his garden wall. He was sure it was the same one; it had the same markings around its eyes. 
43 
44 "Shoo!" said Mr. Dursley loudly. The cat didn't move. It just gave him a stern look. Was this normal cat behavior? Mr. Dursley wondered. Trying to pull himself together, he let himself into the house. He was still determined not to mention anything to his wife. 
45 
46 Mrs. Dursley had had a nice, normal day. She told him over dinner all about Mrs. Next Door's problems with her daughter and how Dudley had learned a new word ("Won't!"). Mr. Dursley tried to act normally. When Dudley had been put to bed, he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news: "And finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported that the nation's owls have been behaving very unusually today. Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight, there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise. Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern." The newscaster allowed himself a grin. 
47 
48 "Most mysterious. And now, over to Jim McGuffin with the weather. Going to be any more showers of owls tonight, Jim?" 
49 
50 "Well, Ted," said the weatherman, "I don't know about that, but it's not only the owls that have been acting oddly today. Viewers as far apart as Kent, Yorkshire, and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday, they've had a downpour of shooting stars! Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early -- it's not until next week, folks! But I can promise a wet night tonight." 
51 
52 Mr. Dursley sat frozen in his armchair. Shooting stars all over Britain? Owls flying by daylight? Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place? And a whisper, a whisper about the Potters... 
53 
54 Mrs. Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea. It was no good. He'd have to say something to her. He cleared his throat nervously. "Er -- Petunia, dear -- you haven't heard from your sister lately, have you?" 
55 
56 As he had expected, Mrs. Dursley looked shocked and angry. After all, they normally pretended she didn't have a sister. 
57 
58 "No," she said sharply. "Why?" 
59 
60 "Funny stuff on the news," Mr. Dursley mumbled. "Owls... shooting stars... and there were a lot of funny-looking people in town today..." 
61 
62 "So?" snapped Mrs. Dursley. 
63 
64 "Well, I just thought... maybe... it was something to do with... you know... her crowd." 
65 
66 Mrs. Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr. Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he'd heard the name "Potter." He decided he didn't dare. Instead he said, as casually as he could, "Their son -- he'd be about Dudley's age now, wouldn't he?" 
67 
68 "I suppose so," said Mrs. Dursley stiffly. 
69 
70 "What's his name again? Howard, isn't it?" 
71 
72 "Harry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me." 
73 
74 "Oh, yes," said Mr. Dursley, his heart sinking horribly. "Yes, I quite agree." 
75 
76 He didn't say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed. 
77 
78 While Mrs. Dursley was in the bathroom, Mr. Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden. The cat was still there. 
79 
80 It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something. 
81 
82 Was he imagining things? Could all this have anything to do with the Potters? If it did... if it got out that they were related to a pair of -- well, he didn't think he could bear it. 
83 
84 The Dursleys got into bed. Mrs. Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr. Dursley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind. His last, comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were involved, there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs. Dursley. The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind.... He couldn't see how he and Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on -- he yawned and turned over -- it couldn't affect them.... 
85 
86 How very wrong he was. 
87 
88 Mr. Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep, but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness. It was sitting as still as a statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive. It didn't so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street, nor when two owls swooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all. 
89 
90 A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching, appeared so suddenly and silently you'd have thought he'd just popped out of the ground. The cat's tail twitched and its eyes narrowed. 
91 
92 Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive. He was tall, thin, and very old, judging by the silver of his hair and beard, which were both long enough to tuck into his belt. He was wearing long robes, a purple cloak that swept the ground, and high-heeled, buckled boots. 
93 
94 His blue eyes were light, bright, and sparkling behind half-moon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked, as though it had been broken at least twice. This man's name was Albus Dumbledore. 
95 
96 Albus Dumbledore didn't seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome. He was busy rummaging in his cloak, looking for something. But he did seem to realize he was being watched, because he looked up suddenly at the cat, which was still staring at him from the other end of the street. For some reason, the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him. He chuckled and muttered, "I should have known." 
97 
98 He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket. It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter. He flicked it open, held it up in the air, and clicked it. The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop. He clicked it again -- the next lamp flickered into darkness. Twelve times he clicked the Put-Outer, until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance, which were the eyes of the cat watching him. If anyone looked out of their window now, even beady-eyed Mrs. Dursley, they wouldn't be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement. Dumbledore slipped the Put-Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four, where he sat down on the wall next to the cat. He didn't look at it, but after a moment he spoke to it. 
99 
100 "Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall." 
101 
102 He turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone. Instead he was smiling at a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes. She, too, was wearing a cloak, an emerald one. Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun. She looked distinctly ruffled. 
103 
104 "How did you know it was me?" she asked. 
105 
106 "My dear Professor, I 've never seen a cat sit so stiffly." 
107 
108 "You'd be stiff if you'd been sitting on a brick wall all day," said Professor McGonagall. 
109 
110 "All day? When you could have been celebrating? I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here." 
111 
112 Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily. 
113 
114 "Oh yes, everyone's celebrating, all right," she said impatiently. 
115 
116 "You'd think they'd be a bit more careful, but no -- even the Muggles have noticed something's going on. It was on their news." She jerked her head back at the Dursleys' dark living-room window. "I heard it. Flocks of owls... shooting stars.... Well, they're not completely stupid. They were bound to notice something. Shooting stars down in Kent -- I'll bet that was Dedalus Diggle. He never had much sense." 
117 
118 "You can't blame them," said Dumbledore gently. "We've had precious little to celebrate for eleven years." 
119 
120 "I know that," said Professor McGonagall irritably. "But that's no reason to lose our heads. People are being downright careless, out on the streets in broad daylight, not even dressed in Muggle clothes, swapping rumors." 
121 
122 She threw a sharp, sideways glance at Dumbledore here, as though hoping he was going to tell her something, but he didn't, so she went on. "A fine thing it would be if, on the very day YouKnow-Who seems to have disappeared at last, the Muggles found out about us all. I suppose he really has gone, Dumbledore?" 
123 
124 "It certainly seems so," said Dumbledore. "We have much to be thankful for. Would you care for a lemon drop?" 
125 
126 "A what?" 
127 
128 "A lemon drop. They're a kind of Muggle sweet I'm rather fond of" 
129 
130 "No, thank you," said Professor McGonagall coldly, as though she didn't think this was the moment for lemon drops. "As I say, even if You-Know-Who has gone -" 
131 
132 "My dear Professor, surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name? All this 'You- Know-Who' nonsense -- for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name: Voldemort." Professor McGonagall flinched, but Dumbledore, who was unsticking two lemon drops, seemed not to notice. "It all gets so confusing if we keep saying 'You-Know-Who.' I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort's name. 
133 
134 "I know you haven 't, said Professor McGonagall, sounding half exasperated, half admiring. "But you're different. Everyone knows you're the only one You-Know- oh, all right, Voldemort, was frightened of." 
135 
136 "You flatter me," said Dumbledore calmly. "Voldemort had powers I will never have." 
137 
138 "Only because you're too -- well -- noble to use them." 
139 
140 "It's lucky it's dark. I haven't blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs." 
141 
142 Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said, "The owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around. You know what everyone's saying? About why he's disappeared? About what finally stopped him?" 
143 
144 It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss, the real reason she had been waiting on a cold, hard wall all day, for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now. It was plain that whatever "everyone" was saying, she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true. Dumbledore, however, was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer. 
145 
146 "What they're saying," she pressed on, "is that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric's Hollow. He went to find the Potters. The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are -- are -- that they're -- dead. � 
147 
148 Dumbledore bowed his head. Professor McGonagall gasped. 
149 
150 "Lily and James... I can't believe it... I didn't want to believe it... 
151 
152 Oh, Albus..." 
153 
154 Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder. "I know... I know..." he said heavily. 
155 
156 Professor McGonagall's voice trembled as she went on. "That's not all. 
157 
158 They're saying he tried to kill the Potter's son, Harry. But -- he couldn't. He couldn't kill that little boy. No one knows why, or how, but they're saying that when he couldn't kill Harry Potter, Voldemort's power somehow broke -- and that's why he's gone. 
159 
160 Dumbledore nodded glumly. 
161 
162 "It's -- it's true?" faltered Professor McGonagall. "After all he's done... all the people he's killed... he couldn't kill a little boy? It's just astounding... of all the things to stop him... but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive?" 
163 
164 "We can only guess," said Dumbledore. "We may never know." 
165 
166 Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles. Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it. It was a very odd watch. 
167 
168 It had twelve hands but no numbers; instead, little planets were moving around the edge. It must have made sense to Dumbledore, though, because he put it back in his pocket and said, "Hagrid's late. I suppose it was he who told you I'd be here, by the way?" 
169 
170 "Yes," said Professor McGonagall. "And I don't suppose you're going to tell me why you're here, of all places?" 
171 
172 "I've come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle. They're the only family he has left now." 
173 
174 "You don't mean -- you can't mean the people who live here?" cried Professor McGonagall, jumping to her feet and pointing at number four. 
175 
176 "Dumbledore -- you can't. I've been watching them all day. You couldn't find two people who are less like us. And they've got this son -- I saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street, screaming for sweets. 
177 
178 Harry Potter come and live here!" 
179 
180 "It's the best place for him," said Dumbledore firmly. "His aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he's older. I've written them a letter." 
181 
182 "A letter?" repeated Professor McGonagall faintly, sitting back down on the wall. "Really, Dumbledore, you think you can explain all this in a letter? These people will never understand him! He'll be famous -- a legend -- I wouldn't be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day in the future -- there will be books written about Harry -- every child in our world will know his name!" 
183 
184 "Exactly," said Dumbledore, looking very seriously over the top of his half-moon glasses. "It would be enough to turn any boy's head. Famous before he can walk and talk! Famous for something he won't even remember! CarA you see how much better off he'll be, growing up away from all that until he's ready to take it?" 
185 
186 Professor McGonagall opened her mouth, changed her mind, swallowed, and then said, "Yes -- yes, you're right, of course. But how is the boy getting here, Dumbledore?" She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it. 
187 
188 "Hagrid's bringing him." 
189 
190 "You think it -- wise -- to trust Hagrid with something as important as this?" 
191 
192 I would trust Hagrid with my life," said Dumbledore. 
193 
194 "I'm not saying his heart isn't in the right place," said Professor McGonagall grudgingly, "but you can't pretend he's not careless. He does tend to -- what was that?" 
195 
196 A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them. It grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight; it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky -- and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them. 
197 
198 If the motorcycle was huge, it was nothing to the man sitting astride it. He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide. He looked simply too big to be allowed, and so wild - long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face, he had hands the size of trash can lids, and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins. In his vast, muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets. 
199 
200 "Hagrid," said Dumbledore, sounding relieved. "At last. And where did you get that motorcycle?" 
201 
202 "Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sit," said the giant, climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke. "Young Sirius Black lent it to me. I've got him, sir." 
203 
204 "No problems, were there?" 
205 
206 "No, sir -- house was almost destroyed, but I got him out all right before the Muggles started swarmin' around. He fell asleep as we was flyin' over Bristol." 
207 
208 Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets. Inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast asleep. Under a tuft of jet-black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut, like a bolt of lightning. 
209 
210 "Is that where -?" whispered Professor McGonagall. 
211 
212 "Yes," said Dumbledore. "He'll have that scar forever." 
213 
214 "Couldn't you do something about it, Dumbledore?" 
215 
216 "Even if I could, I wouldn't. Scars can come in handy. I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground. Well -- give him here, Hagrid -- we'd better get this over with." 
217 
218 Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys' house. 
219 
220 "Could I -- could I say good-bye to him, sir?" asked Hagrid. He bent his great, shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy, whiskery kiss. Then, suddenly, Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog. 
221 
222 "Shhh!" hissed Professor McGonagall, "you'll wake the Muggles!" 
223 
224 "S-s-sorry," sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large, spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it. "But I c-c-can't stand it -- Lily an' James dead -- an' poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles -" 
225 
226 "Yes, yes, it's all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid, or we'll be found," Professor McGonagall whispered, patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door. He laid Harry gently on the doorstep, took a letter out of his cloak, tucked it inside Harry's blankets, and then came back to the other two. For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle; Hagrid's shoulders shook, Professor McGonagall blinked furiously, and the twinkling light that usually shone from Dumbledore's eyes seemed to have gone out. 
227 
228 "Well," said Dumbledore finally, "that's that. We've no business staying here. We may as well go and join the celebrations." 
229 
230 "Yeah," said Hagrid in a very muffled voice, "I'll be takin' Sirius his bike back. G'night, Professor McGonagall -- Professor Dumbledore, sir." 
231 
232 Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life; with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night. 
233 
234 "I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall," said Dumbledore, nodding to her. Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply. 
235 
236 Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street. On the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put-Outer. He clicked it once, and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street. He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four. 
237 
238 "Good luck, Harry," he murmured. He turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak, he was gone. 
239 
240 A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky, the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen. Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up. One small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on, not knowing he was special, not knowing he was famous, not knowing he would be woken in a few hours' time by Mrs. Dursley's scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles, nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley... He couldn't know that at this very moment, people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices: "To Harry Potter -- the boy who lived!" 
241 
242 CHAPTER TWO 
243 
244 THE VANISHING GLASS 
245 
246 Nearly ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken up to find their nephew on the front step, but Privet Drive had hardly changed at all. The sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass number four on the Dursleys' front door; it crept into their living room, which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when Mr. Dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls. Only the photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed. 
247 
248 Ten years ago, there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach ball wearing different-colored bonnets -- but Dudley Dursley was no longer a baby, and now the photographs showed a large blond boy riding his first bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing a computer game with his father, being hugged and kissed by his mother. 
249 
250 The room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house, too. 
251 
252 Yet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, but not for long. His Aunt Petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice that made the first noise of the day. 
253 
254 "Up! Get up! Now!" 
255 
256 Harry woke with a start. His aunt rapped on the door again. 
257 
258 "Up!" she screeched. Harry heard her walking toward the kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan being put on the stove. He rolled onto his back and tried to remember the dream he had been having. It had been a good one. There had been a flying motorcycle in it. He had a funny feeling he'd had the same dream before. 
259 
260 His aunt was back outside the door. 
261 
262 "Are you up yet?" she demanded. 
263 
264 "Nearly," said Harry. 
265 
266 "Well, get a move on, I want you to look after the bacon. And don't you dare let it burn, I want everything perfect on Duddy's birthday." 
267 
268 Harry groaned. 
269 
270 "What did you say?" his aunt snapped through the door. 
271 
272 "Nothing, nothing..." 
273 
274 Dudley's birthday -- how could he have forgotten? Harry got slowly out of bed and started looking for socks. He found a pair under his bed and, after pulling a spider off one of them, put them on. Harry was used to spiders, because the cupboard under the stairs was full of them, and that was where he slept. 
275 
276 When he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen. The table was almost hidden beneath all Dudley's birthday presents. It looked as though Dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted, not to mention the second television and the racing bike. Exactly why Dudley wanted a racing bike was a mystery to Harry, as Dudley was very fat and hated exercise -- unless of course it involved punching somebody. Dudley's favorite punching bag was Harry, but he couldn't often catch him. Harry didn't look it, but he was very fast. 
277 
278 Perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard, but Harry had always been small and skinny for his age. He looked even smaller and skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes of Dudley's, and Dudley was about four times bigger than he was. Harry had a thin face, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green eyes. He wore round glasses held together with a lot of Scotch tape because of all the times Dudley had punched him on the nose. The only thing Harry liked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning. He had had it as long as he could remember, and the first question he could ever remember asking his Aunt Petunia was how he had gotten it. 
279 
280 "In the car crash when your parents died," she had said. "And don't ask questions." 
281 
282 Don't ask questions -- that was the first rule for a quiet life with the Dursleys. 
283 
284 Uncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was turning over the bacon. 
285 
286 "Comb your hair!" he barked, by way of a morning greeting. 
287 
288 About once a week, Uncle Vernon looked over the top of his newspaper and shouted that Harry needed a haircut. Harry must have had more haircuts than the rest of the boys in his class put together, but it made no difference, his hair simply grew that way -- all over the place. 
289 
290 Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his mother. Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon. He had a large pink face, not much neck, small, watery blue eyes, and thick blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick, fat head. Aunt Petunia often said that Dudley looked like a baby angel -- Harry often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a wig. 
291 
292 Harry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table, which was difficult as there wasn't much room. Dudley, meanwhile, was counting his presents. 
293 
294 His face fell. 
295 
296 "Thirty-six," he said, looking up at his mother and father. "That's two less than last year." 
297 
298 "Darling, you haven't counted Auntie Marge's present, see, it's here under this big one from Mommy and Daddy." 
299 
300 "All right, thirty-seven then," said Dudley, going red in the face. 
301 
302 Harry, who could see a huge Dudley tantrum coming on, began wolfing down his bacon as fast as possible in case Dudley turned the table over. 
303 
304 Aunt Petunia obviously scented danger, too, because she said quickly, "And we'll buy you another two presents while we're out today. How's that, popkin? Two more presents. Is that all right'' Dudley thought for a moment. It looked like hard work. Finally he said slowly, "So I'll have thirty ... thirty..." 
305 
306 "Thirty-nine, sweetums," said Aunt Petunia. 
307 
308 "Oh." Dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel. "All right then." 
309 
310 Uncle Vernon chuckled. "Little tyke wants his money's worth, just like his father. 'Atta boy, Dudley!" He ruffled Dudley's hair. 
311 
312 At that moment the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia went to answer it while Harry and Uncle Vernon watched Dudley unwrap the racing bike, a video camera, a remote control airplane, sixteen new computer games, and a VCR. He was ripping the paper off a gold wristwatch when Aunt Petunia came back from the telephone looking both angry and worried. 
313 
314 "Bad news, Vernon," she said. "Mrs. Figg's broken her leg. She can't take him." She jerked her head in Harry's direction. 
315 
316 Dudley's mouth fell open in horror, but Harry's heart gave a leap. Every year on Dudley's birthday, his parents took him and a friend out for the day, to adventure parks, hamburger restaurants, or the movies. Every year, Harry was left behind with Mrs. Figg, a mad old lady who lived two streets away. Harry hated it there. The whole house smelled of cabbage and Mrs. Figg made him look at photographs of all the cats she'd ever owned. 
317 
318 "Now what?" said Aunt Petunia, looking furiously at Harry as though he'd planned this. Harry knew he ought to feel sorry that Mrs. Figg had broken her leg, but it wasn't easy when he reminded himself it would be a whole year before he had to look at Tibbles, Snowy, Mr. Paws, and Tufty again. 
319 
320 "We could phone Marge," Uncle Vernon suggested. 
321 
322 "Don't be silly, Vernon, she hates the boy." 
323 
324 The Dursleys often spoke about Harry like this, as though he wasn't there -- or rather, as though he was something very nasty that couldn't understand them, like a slug. 
325 
326 "What about what's-her-name, your friend -- Yvonne?" 
327 
328 "On vacation in Majorca," snapped Aunt Petunia. 
329 
330 "You could just leave me here," Harry put in hopefully (he'd be able to watch what he wanted on television for a change and maybe even have a go on Dudley's computer). 
331 
332 Aunt Petunia looked as though she'd just swallowed a lemon. 
333 
334 "And come back and find the house in ruins?" she snarled. 
335 
336 "I won't blow up the house," said Harry, but they weren't listening. 
337 
338 "I suppose we could take him to the zoo," said Aunt Petunia slowly, "... 
339 
340 and leave him in the car...." 
341 
342 "That car's new, he's not sitting in it alone...." 
343 
344 Dudley began to cry loudly. In fact, he wasn't really crying -- it had been years since he'd really cried -- but he knew that if he screwed up his face and wailed, his mother would give him anything he wanted. 
345 
346 "Dinky Duddydums, don't cry, Mummy won't let him spoil your special day!" she cried, flinging her arms around him. 
347 
348 "I... don't... want... him... t-t-to come!" Dudley yelled between huge, pretend sobs. "He always sp- spoils everything!" He shot Harry a nasty grin through the gap in his mother's arms. 
349 
350 Just then, the doorbell rang -- "Oh, good Lord, they're here!" said Aunt Petunia frantically -- and a moment later, Dudley's best friend, Piers Polkiss, walked in with his mother. Piers was a scrawny boy with a face like a rat. He was usually the one who held people's arms behind their backs while Dudley hit them. Dudley stopped pretending to cry at once. 
351 
352 Half an hour later, Harry, who couldn't believe his luck, was sitting in the back of the Dursleys' car with Piers and Dudley, on the way to the zoo for the first time in his life. His aunt and uncle hadn't been able to think of anything else to do with him, but before they'd left, Uncle Vernon had taken Harry aside. 
353 
354 "I'm warning you," he had said, putting his large purple face right up close to Harry's, "I'm warning you now, boy -- any funny business, anything at all -- and you'll be in that cupboard from now until Christmas." 
355 
356 "I'm not going to do anything," said Harry, "honestly.. 
357 
358 But Uncle Vernon didn't believe him. No one ever did. 
359 
360 The problem was, strange things often happened around Harry and it was just no good telling the Dursleys he didn't make them happen. 
361 
362 Once, Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming back from the barbers looking as though he hadn't been at all, had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair so short he was almost bald except for his bangs, which she left "to hide that horrible scar." Dudley had laughed himself silly at Harry, who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day, where he was already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped glasses. 
363 
364 Next morning, however, he had gotten up to find his hair exactly as it had been before Aunt Petunia had sheared it off He had been given a week in his cupboard for this, even though he had tried to explain that he couldn't explain how it had grown back so quickly. 
365 
366 Another time, Aunt Petunia had been trying to force him into a revolting old sweater of Dudley's (brown with orange puff balls) -- The harder she tried to pull it over his head, the smaller it seemed to become, until finally it might have fitted a hand puppet, but certainly wouldn't fit Harry. Aunt Petunia had decided it must have shrunk in the wash and, to his great relief, Harry wasn't punished. 
367 
368 On the other hand, he'd gotten into terrible trouble for being found on the roof of the school kitchens. Dudley's gang had been chasing him as usual when, as much to Harry's surprise as anyone else's, there he was sitting on the chimney. The Dursleys had received a very angry letter from Harry's headmistress telling them Harry had been climbing school buildings. But all he'd tried to do (as he shouted at Uncle Vernon through the locked door of his cupboard) was jump behind the big trash cans outside the kitchen doors. Harry supposed that the wind must have caught him in mid- jump. 
369 
370 But today, nothing was going to go wrong. It was even worth being with Dudley and Piers to be spending the day somewhere that wasn't school, his cupboard, or Mrs. Figg's cabbage-smelling living room. 
371 
372 While he drove, Uncle Vernon complained to Aunt Petunia. He liked to complain about things: people at work, Harry, the council, Harry, the bank, and Harry were just a few of his favorite subjects. This morning, it was motorcycles. 
373 
374 "... roaring along like maniacs, the young hoodlums," he said, as a motorcycle overtook them. 
375 
376 I had a dream about a motorcycle," said Harry, remembering suddenly. "It was flying." 
377 
378 Uncle Vernon nearly crashed into the car in front. He turned right around in his seat and yelled at Harry, his face like a gigantic beet with a mustache: "MOTORCYCLES DON'T FLY!" 
379 
380 Dudley and Piers sniggered. 
381 
382 I know they don't," said Harry. "It was only a dream." 
383 
384 But he wished he hadn't said anything. If there was one thing the Dursleys hated even more than his asking questions, it was his talking about anything acting in a way it shouldn't, no matter if it was in a dream or even a cartoon -- they seemed to think he might get dangerous ideas. 
385 
386 It was a very sunny Saturday and the zoo was crowded with families. The Dursleys bought Dudley and Piers large chocolate ice creams at the entrance and then, because the smiling lady in the van had asked Harry what he wanted before they could hurry him away, they bought him a cheap lemon ice pop. It wasn't bad, either, Harry thought, licking it as they watched a gorilla scratching its head who looked remarkably like Dudley, except that it wasn't blond. 
387 
388 Harry had the best morning he'd had in a long time. He was careful to walk a little way apart from the Dursleys so that Dudley and Piers, who were starting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime, wouldn't fall back on their favorite hobby of hitting him. They ate in the zoo restaurant, and when Dudley had a tantrum because his knickerbocker glory didn't have enough ice cream on top, Uncle Vernon bought him another one and Harry was allowed to finish the first. 
389 
390 Harry felt, afterward, that he should have known it was all too good to last. 
391 
392 After lunch they went to the reptile house. It was cool and dark in there, with lit windows all along the walls. Behind the glass, all sorts of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and stone. Dudley and Piers wanted to see huge, poisonous cobras and thick, man-crushing pythons. Dudley quickly found the largest snake in the place. It could have wrapped its body twice around Uncle Vernon's car and crushed it into a trash can -- but at the moment it didn't look in the mood. In fact, it was fast asleep. 
393 
394 Dudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass, staring at the glistening brown coils. 
395 
396 "Make it move," he whined at his father. Uncle Vernon tapped on the glass, but the snake didn't budge. 
397 
398 "Do it again," Dudley ordered. Uncle Vernon rapped the glass smartly with his knuckles, but the snake just snoozed on. 
399 
400 "This is boring," Dudley moaned. He shuffled away. 
401 
402 Harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake. He wouldn't have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself -- no company except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying to disturb it all day long. It was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom, where the only visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door to wake you up; at least he got to visit the rest of the house. 
403 
404 The snake suddenly opened its beady eyes. Slowly, very slowly, it raised its head until its eyes were on a level with Harry's. 
405 
406 It winked. 
407 
408 Harry stared. Then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was watching. They weren't. He looked back at the snake and winked, too. 
409 
410 The snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley, then raised its eyes to the ceiling. It gave Harry a look that said quite plainly: "I get that all the time. 
411 
412 "I know," Harry murmured through the glass, though he wasn't sure the snake could hear him. "It must be really annoying." 
413 
414 The snake nodded vigorously. 
415 
416 "Where do you come from, anyway?" Harry asked. 
417 
418 The snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass. Harry peered at it. 
419 
420 Boa Constrictor, Brazil. 
421 
422 "Was it nice there?" 
423 
424 The boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and Harry read on: This specimen was bred in the zoo. "Oh, I see -- so you've never been to Brazil?" 
425 
426 As the snake shook its head, a deafening shout behind Harry made both of them jump. 
427 
428 "DUDLEY! MR. DURSLEY! COME AND LOOK AT THIS SNAKE! YOU WON'T BELIEVE WHAT IT'S DOING!" 
429 
430 Dudley came waddling toward them as fast as he could. 
431 
432 "Out of the way, you," he said, punching Harry in the ribs. Caught by surprise, Harry fell hard on the concrete floor. What came next happened so fast no one saw how it happened -- one second, Piers and Dudley were leaning right up close to the glass, the next, they had leapt back with howls of horror. 
433 
434 Harry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa constrictor's tank had vanished. The great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly, slithering out onto the floor. People throughout the reptile house screamed and started running for the exits. 
435 
436 As the snake slid swiftly past him, Harry could have sworn a low, hissing voice said, "Brazil, here I come.... Thanksss, amigo." 
437 
438 The keeper of the reptile house was in shock. 
439 
440 "But the glass," he kept saying, "where did the glass go?" 
441 
442 The zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of strong, sweet tea while he apologized over and over again. Piers and Dudley could only gibber. As far as Harry had seen, the snake hadn't done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it passed, but by the time they were all back in Uncle Vernon's car, Dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg, while Piers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death. But worst of all, for Harry at least, was Piers calming down enough to say, "Harry was talking to it, weren't you, Harry?" 
443 
444 Uncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house before starting on Harry. He was so angry he could hardly speak. He managed to say, "Go -- cupboard -- stay -- no meals," before he collapsed into a chair, and Aunt Petunia had to run and get him a large brandy. 
445 
446 Harry lay in his dark cupboard much later, wishing he had a watch. He didn't know what time it was and he couldn't be sure the Dursleys were asleep yet. Until they were, he couldn't risk sneaking to the kitchen for some food. 
447 
448 He'd lived with the Dursleys almost ten years, ten miserable years, as long as he could remember, ever since he'd been a baby and his parents had died in that car crash. He couldn't remember being in the car when his parents had died. Sometimes, when he strained his memory during long hours in his cupboard, he came up with a strange vision: a blinding flash of green light and a burn- ing pain on his forehead. This, he supposed, was the crash, though he couldn't imagine where all the green light came from. He couldn't remember his parents at all. His aunt and uncle never spoke about them, and of course he was forbidden to ask questions. There were no photographs of them in the house. 
449 
450 When he had been younger, Harry had dreamed and dreamed of some unknown relation coming to take him away, but it had never happened; the Dursleys were his only family. Yet sometimes he thought (or maybe hoped) that strangers in the street seemed to know him. Very strange strangers they were, too. A tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once while out shopping with Aunt Petunia and Dudley. After asking Harry furiously if he knew the man, Aunt Petunia had rushed them out of the shop without buying anything. A wild-looking old woman dressed all in green had waved merrily at him once on a bus. A bald man in a very long purple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and then walked away without a word. The weirdest thing about all these people was the way they seemed to vanish the second Harry tried to get a closer look. 
451 
452 At school, Harry had no one. Everybody knew that Dudley's gang hated that odd Harry Potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and nobody liked to disagree with Dudley's gang. 
453 
454 CHAPTER THREE 
455 
456 THE LETTERS FROM NO ONE 
457 
458 The escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor earned Harry his longest-ever punishment. By the time he was allowed out of his cupboard again, the summer holidays had started and Dudley had already broken his new video camera, crashed his remote control airplane, and, first time out on his racing bike, knocked down old Mrs. Figg as she crossed Privet Drive on her crutches. 
459 
460 Harry was glad school was over, but there was no escaping Dudley's gang, who visited the house every single day. Piers, Dennis, Malcolm, and Gordon were all big and stupid, but as Dudley was the biggest and stupidest of the lot, he was the leader. The rest of them were all quite happy to join in Dudley's favorite sport: Harry Hunting. 
461 
462 This was why Harry spent as much time as possible out of the house, wandering around and thinking about the end of the holidays, where he could see a tiny ray of hope. When September came he would be going off to secondary school and, for the first time in his life, he wouldn't be with Dudley. Dudley had been accepted at Uncle Vernon's old private school, Smeltings. Piers Polkiss was going there too. Harry, on the other hand, was going to Stonewall High, the local public school. Dudley thought this was very funny. 
463 
464 "They stuff people's heads down the toilet the first day at Stonewall," 
465 
466 he told Harry. "Want to come upstairs and practice?" 
467 
468 "No, thanks," said Harry. "The poor toilet's never had anything as horrible as your head down it -- it might be sick." Then he ran, before Dudley could work out what he'd said. 
469 
470 One day in July, Aunt Petunia took Dudley to London to buy his Smeltings uniform, leaving Harry at Mrs. Figg's. Mrs. Figg wasn 't as bad as usual. It turned out she'd broken her leg tripping over one of her cats, and she didn't seem quite as fond of them as before. She let Harry watch television and gave him a bit of chocolate cake that tasted as though she'd had it for several years. 
471 
472 That evening, Dudley paraded around the living room for the family in his brand-new uniform. Smeltings' boys wore maroon tailcoats, orange knickerbockers, and flat straw hats called boaters. They also carried knobbly sticks, used for hitting each other while the teachers weren't looking. This was supposed to be good training for later life. 
473 
474 As he looked at Dudley in his new knickerbockers, Uncle Vernon said gruffly that it was the proudest moment of his life. Aunt Petunia burst into tears and said she couldn't believe it was her Ickle Dudleykins, he looked so handsome and grown-up. Harry didn't trust himself to speak. He thought two of his ribs might already have cracked from trying not to laugh. 
475 
476 There was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next morning when Harry went in for breakfast. It seemed to be coming from a large metal tub in the sink. He went to have a look. The tub was full of what looked like dirty rags swimming in gray water. 
477 
478 "What's this?" he asked Aunt Petunia. Her lips tightened as they always did if he dared to ask a question. 
479 
480 "Your new school uniform," she said. 
481 
482 Harry looked in the bowl again. 
483 
484 "Oh," he said, "I didn't realize it had to be so wet." 
485 
486 "DotA be stupid," snapped Aunt Petunia. "I'm dyeing some of Dudley's old things gray for you. It'll look just like everyone else's when I've finished." 
487 
488 Harry seriously doubted this, but thought it best not to argue. He sat down at the table and tried not to think about how he was going to look on his first day at Stonewall High -- like he was wearing bits of old elephant skin, probably. 
489 
490 Dudley and Uncle Vernon came in, both with wrinkled noses because of the smell from Harry's new uniform. Uncle Vernon opened his newspaper as usual and Dudley banged his Smelting stick, which he carried everywhere, on the table. 
491 
492 They heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters on the doormat. 
493 
494 "Get the mail, Dudley," said Uncle Vernon from behind his paper. 
495 
496 "Make Harry get it." 
497 
498 "Get the mail, Harry." 
499 
500 "Make Dudley get it." 
501 
502 "Poke him with your Smelting stick, Dudley." 
503 
504 Harry dodged the Smelting stick and went to get the mail. Three things lay on the doormat: a postcard from Uncle Vernon's sister Marge, who was vacationing on the Isle of Wight, a brown envelope that looked like a bill, and -- a letter for Harry. 
505 
506 Harry picked it up and stared at it, his heart twanging like a giant elastic band. No one, ever, in his whole life, had written to him. Who would? He had no friends, no other relatives -- he didn't belong to the library, so he'd never even got rude notes asking for books back. Yet here it was, a letter, addressed so plainly there could be no mistake: Mr. H. Potter The Cupboard under the Stairs 4 Privet Drive Little Whinging Surrey The envelope was thick and heavy, made of yellowish parchment, and the address was written in emerald-green ink. There was no stamp. 
507 
508 Turning the envelope over, his hand trembling, Harry saw a purple wax seal bearing a coat of arms; a lion, an eagle, a badger, and a snake surrounding a large letter H. 
509 
510 "Hurry up, boy!" shouted Uncle Vernon from the kitchen. "What are you doing, checking for letter bombs?" He chuckled at his own joke. 
511 
512 Harry went back to the kitchen, still staring at his letter. He handed Uncle Vernon the bill and the postcard, sat down, and slowly began to open the yellow envelope. 
513 
514 Uncle Vernon ripped open the bill, snorted in disgust, and flipped over the postcard. 
515 
516 "Marge's ill," he informed Aunt Petunia. "Ate a funny whelk. --." 
517 
518 "Dad!" said Dudley suddenly. "Dad, Harry's got something!" 
519 
520 Harry was on the point of unfolding his letter, which was written on the same heavy parchment as the envelope, when it was jerked sharply out of his hand by Uncle Vernon. 
521 
522 "That's mine!" said Harry, trying to snatch it back. 
523 
524 "Who'd be writing to you?" sneered Uncle Vernon, shaking the letter open with one hand and glancing at it. His face went from red to green faster than a set of traffic lights. And it didn't stop there. Within seconds it was the grayish white of old porridge. 
525 
526 "P-P-Petunia!" he gasped. 
527 
528 Dudley tried to grab the letter to read it, but Uncle Vernon held it high out of his reach. Aunt Petunia took it curiously and read the first line. For a moment it looked as though she might faint. She clutched her throat and made a choking noise. 
529 
530 "Vernon! Oh my goodness -- Vernon!" 
531 
532 They stared at each other, seeming to have forgotten that Harry and Dudley were still in the room. Dudley wasn't used to being ignored. He gave his father a sharp tap on the head with his Smelting stick. 
533 
534 "I want to read that letter," he said loudly. want to read it," said Harry furiously, "as it's mine." 
535 
536 "Get out, both of you," croaked Uncle Vernon, stuffing the letter back inside its envelope. 
537 
538 Harry didn't move. 
539 
540 I WANT MY LETTER!" he shouted. 
541 
542 "Let me see it!" demanded Dudley. 
543 
544 "OUT!" roared Uncle Vernon, and he took both Harry and Dudley by the scruffs of their necks and threw them into the hall, slamming the kitchen door behind them. Harry and Dudley promptly had a furious but silent fight over who would listen at the keyhole; Dudley won, so Harry, his glasses dangling from one ear, lay flat on his stomach to listen at the crack between door and floor. 
545 
546 "Vernon," Aunt Petunia was saying in a quivering voice, "look at the address -- how could they possibly know where he sleeps? You don't think they're watching the house?" 
547 
548 "Watching -- spying -- might be following us," muttered Uncle Vernon wildly. 
549 
550 "But what should we do, Vernon? Should we write back? Tell them we don't want --" 
551 
552 Harry could see Uncle Vernon's shiny black shoes pacing up and down the kitchen. 
553 
554 "No," he said finally. "No, we'll ignore it. If they don't get an answer... Yes, that's best... we won't do anything.... 
555 
556 "But --" 
557 
558 "I'm not having one in the house, Petunia! Didn't we swear when we took him in we'd stamp out that dangerous nonsense?" 
559 
560 That evening when he got back from work, Uncle Vernon did something he'd never done before; he visited Harry in his cupboard. 
561 
562 "Where's my letter?" said Harry, the moment Uncle Vernon had squeezed through the door. "Who's writing to me?" 
563 
564 "No one. it was addressed to you by mistake," said Uncle Vernon shortly. 
565 
566 "I have burned it." 
567 
568 "It was not a mistake," said Harry angrily, "it had my cupboard on it." 
569 
570 "SILENCE!" yelled Uncle Vernon, and a couple of spiders fell from the ceiling. He took a few deep breaths and then forced his face into a smile, which looked quite painful. 
571 
572 "Er -- yes, Harry -- about this cupboard. Your aunt and I have been thinking... you're really getting a bit big for it... we think it might be nice if you moved into Dudley's second bedroom. 
573 
574 "Why?" said Harry. 
575 
576 "Don't ask questions!" snapped his uncle. "Take this stuff upstairs, now." 
577 
578 The Dursleys' house had four bedrooms: one for Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia, one for visitors (usually Uncle Vernon's sister, Marge), one where Dudley slept, and one where Dudley kept all the toys and things that wouldn't fit into his first bedroom. It only took Harry one trip upstairs to move everything he owned from the cupboard to this room. He sat down on the bed and stared around him. Nearly everything in here was broken. The month-old video camera was lying on top of a small, working tank Dudley had once driven over the next door neighbor's dog; in the corner was Dudley's first-ever television set, which he'd put his foot through when his favorite program had been canceled; there was a large birdcage, which had once held a parrot that Dudley had swapped at school for a real air rifle, which was up on a shelf with the end all bent because Dudley had sat on it. Other shelves were full of books. They were the only things in the room that looked as though they'd never been touched. 
579 
580 From downstairs came the sound of Dudley bawling at his mother, I don't want him in there... I need that room... make him get out...." 
581 
582 Harry sighed and stretched out on the bed. Yesterday he'd have given anything to be up here. Today he'd rather be back in his cupboard with that letter than up here without it. 
583 
584 Next morning at breakfast, everyone was rather quiet. Dudley was in shock. He'd screamed, whacked his father with his Smelting stick, been sick on purpose, kicked his mother, and thrown his tortoise through the greenhouse roof, and he still didn't have his room back. Harry was thinking about this time yesterday and bitterly wishing he'd opened the letter in the hall. Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia kept looking at each other darkly. 
585 
586 When the mail arrived, Uncle Vernon, who seemed to be trying to be nice to Harry, made Dudley go and get it. They heard him banging things with his Smelting stick all the way down the hall. Then he shouted, "There's another one! 'Mr. H. Potter, The Smallest Bedroom, 4 Privet Drive --'� 
587 
588 With a strangled cry, Uncle Vernon leapt from his seat and ran down the hall, Harry right behind him. Uncle Vernon had to wrestle Dudley to the ground to get the letter from him, which was made difficult by the fact that Harry had grabbed Uncle Vernon around the neck from behind. After a minute of confused fighting, in which everyone got hit a lot by the Smelting stick, Uncle Vernon straightened up, gasping for breath, with Harry's letter clutched in his hand. 
589 
590 "Go to your cupboard -- I mean, your bedroom," he wheezed at Harry. 
591 
592 "Dudley -- go -- just go." 
593 
594 Harry walked round and round his new room. Someone knew he had moved out of his cupboard and they seemed to know he hadn't received his first letter. Surely that meant they'd try again? And this time he'd make sure they didn't fail. He had a plan. 
595 
596 The repaired alarm clock rang at six o'clock the next morning. Harry turned it off quickly and dressed silently. He mustn't wake the Dursleys. He stole downstairs without turning on any of the lights. 
597 
598 He was going to wait for the postman on the corner of Privet Drive and get the letters for number four first. His heart hammered as he crept across the dark hall toward the front door -- Harry leapt into the air; he'd trodden on something big and squashy on the doormat -- something alive! Lights clicked on upstairs and to his horror Harry realized that the big, squashy something had been his uncle's face. Uncle Vernon had been lying at the foot of the front door in a sleeping bag, clearly making sure that Harry didn't do exactly what he'd been trying to do. He shouted at Harry for about half an hour and then told him to go and make a cup of tea. Harry shuffled miserably off into the kitchen and by the time he got back, the mail had arrived, right into Uncle Vernon's lap. 
599 
600 Harry could see three letters addressed in green ink. 
601 
602 I want --" he began, but Uncle Vernon was tearing the letters into pieces before his eyes. Uncle Vernon didnt go to work that day. He stayed at home and nailed up the mail slot. 
603 
604 "See," he explained to Aunt Petunia through a mouthful of nails, "if they can't deliver them they'll just give up." 
605 
606 "I'm not sure that'll work, Vernon." 
607 
608 "Oh, these people's minds work in strange ways, Petunia, they're not like you and me," said Uncle Vernon, trying to knock in a nail with the piece of fruitcake Aunt Petunia had just brought him. 
609 
610 On Friday, no less than twelve letters arrived for Harry. As they couldn't go through the mail slot they had been pushed under the door, slotted through the sides, and a few even forced through the small window in the downstairs bathroom. 
611 
612 Uncle Vernon stayed at home again. After burning all the letters, he got out a hammer and nails and boarded up the cracks around the front and back doors so no one could go out. He hummed "Tiptoe Through the Tulips" 
613 
614 as he worked, and jumped at small noises. 
615 
616 On Saturday, things began to get out of hand. Twenty-four letters to Harry found their way into the house, rolled up and hidden inside each of the two dozen eggs that their very confused milkman had handed Aunt Petunia through the living room window. While Uncle Vernon made furious telephone calls to the post office and the dairy trying to find someone to complain to, Aunt Petunia shredded the letters in her food processor. 
617 
618 "Who on earth wants to talk to you this badly?" Dudley asked Harry in amazement. 
619 
620 On Sunday morning, Uncle Vernon sat down at the breakfast table looking tired and rather ill, but happy. 
621 
622 "No post on Sundays," he reminded them cheerfully as he spread marmalade on his newspapers, "no damn letters today --" 
623 
624 Something came whizzing down the kitchen chimney as he spoke and caught him sharply on the back of the head. Next moment, thirty or forty letters came pelting out of the fireplace like bullets. The Dursleys ducked, but Harry leapt into the air trying to catch one. 
625 
626 "Out! OUT!" 
627 
628 Uncle Vernon seized Harry around the waist and threw him into the hall. 
629 
630 When Aunt Petunia and Dudley had run out with their arms over their faces, Uncle Vernon slammed the door shut. They could hear the letters still streaming into the room, bouncing off the walls and floor. 
631 
632 "That does it," said Uncle Vernon, trying to speak calmly but pulling great tufts out of his mustache at the same time. I want you all back here in five minutes ready to leave. We're going away. Just pack some clothes. No arguments!" 
633 
634 He looked so dangerous with half his mustache missing that no one dared argue. Ten minutes later they had wrenched their way through the boarded-up doors and were in the car, speeding toward the highway. 
635 
636 Dudley was sniffling in the back seat; his father had hit him round the head for holding them up while he tried to pack his television, VCR, and computer in his sports bag. 
637 
638 They drove. And they drove. Even Aunt Petunia didn't dare ask where they were going. Every now and then Uncle Vernon would take a sharp turn and drive in the opposite direction for a while. "Shake'em off... shake 'em off," he would mutter whenever he did this. 
639 
640 They didn't stop to eat or drink all day. By nightfall Dudley was howling. He'd never had such a bad day in his life. He was hungry, he'd missed five television programs he'd wanted to see, and he'd never gone so long without blowing up an alien on his computer. 
641 
642 Uncle Vernon stopped at last outside a gloomy-looking hotel on the outskirts of a big city. Dudley and Harry shared a room with twin beds and damp, musty sheets. Dudley snored but Harry stayed awake, sitting on the windowsill, staring down at the lights of passing cars and wondering.... 
643 
644 They ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on toast for breakfast the next day. They had just finished when the owner of the hotel came over to their table. 
645 
646 "'Scuse me, but is one of you Mr. H. Potter? Only I got about an 'undred of these at the front desk." 
647 
648 She held up a letter so they could read the green ink address: Mr. H. Potter Room 17 Railview Hotel Cokeworth Harry made a grab for the letter but Uncle Vernon knocked his hand out of the way. The woman stared. 
649 
650 "I'll take them," said Uncle Vernon, standing up quickly and following her from the dining room. 
651 
652 Wouldn't it be better just to go home, dear?" Aunt Petunia suggested timidly, hours later, but Uncle Vernon didn't seem to hear her. Exactly what he was looking for, none of them knew. He drove them into the middle of a forest, got out, looked around, shook his head, got back in the car, and off they went again. The same thing happened in the middle of a plowed field, halfway across a suspension bridge, and at the top of a multilevel parking garage. 
653 
654 "Daddy's gone mad, hasn't he?" Dudley asked Aunt Petunia dully late that afternoon. Uncle Vernon had parked at the coast, locked them all inside the car, and disappeared. 
655 
656 It started to rain. Great drops beat on the roof of the car. Dud ley sniveled. 
657 
658 "It's Monday," he told his mother. "The Great Humberto's on tonight. I want to stay somewhere with a television. � 
659 
660 Monday. This reminded Harry of something. If it was Monday -- and you could usually count on Dudley to know the days the week, because of television -- then tomorrow, Tuesday, was Harry's eleventh birthday. Of course, his birthdays were never exactly fun -- last year, the Dursleys had given him a coat hanger and a pair of Uncle Vernon's old socks. 
661 
662 Still, you weren't eleven every day. 
663 
664 Uncle Vernon was back and he was smiling. He was also carrying a long, thin package and didn't answer Aunt Petunia when she asked what he'd bought. 
665 
666 "Found the perfect place!" he said. "Come on! Everyone out!" 
667 
668 It was very cold outside the car. Uncle Vernon was pointing at what looked like a large rock way out at sea. Perched on top of the rock was the most miserable little shack you could imagine. One thing was certain, there was no television in there. 
669 
670 "Storm forecast for tonight!" said Uncle Vernon gleefully, clapping his hands together. "And this gentleman's kindly agreed to lend us his boat!" 
671 
672 A toothless old man came ambling up to them, pointing, with a rather wicked grin, at an old rowboat bobbing in the iron-gray water below them. 
673 
674 "I've already got us some rations," said Uncle Vernon, "so all aboard!" 
675 
676 It was freezing in the boat. Icy sea spray and rain crept down their necks and a chilly wind whipped their faces. After what seemed like hours they reached the rock, where Uncle Vernon, slipping and sliding, led the way to the broken-down house. 
677 
678 The inside was horrible; it smelled strongly of seaweed, the wind whistled through the gaps in the wooden walls, and the fireplace was damp and empty. There were only two rooms. 
679 
680 Uncle Vernon's rations turned out to be a bag of chips each and four bananas. He tried to start a fire but the empty chip bags just smoked and shriveled up. 
681 
682 "Could do with some of those letters now, eh?" he said cheerfully. 
683 
684 He was in a very good mood. Obviously he thought nobody stood a chance of reaching them here in a storm to deliver mail. Harry privately agreed, though the thought didn't cheer him up at all. 
685 
686 As night fell, the promised storm blew up around them. Spray from the high waves splattered the walls of the hut and a fierce wind rattled the filthy windows. Aunt Petunia found a few moldy blankets in the second room and made up a bed for Dudley on the moth-eaten sofa. She and Uncle Vernon went off to the lumpy bed next door, and Harry was left to find the softest bit of floor he could and to curl up under the thinnest, most ragged blanket. 
687 
688 The storm raged more and more ferociously as the night went on. Harry couldn't sleep. He shivered and turned over, trying to get comfortable, his stomach rumbling with hunger. Dudley's snores were drowned by the low rolls of thunder that started near midnight. The lighted dial of Dudley's watch, which was dangling over the edge of the sofa on his fat wrist, told Harry he'd be eleven in ten minutes' time. He lay and watched his birthday tick nearer, wondering if the Dursleys would remember at all, wondering where the letter writer was now. 
689 
690 Five minutes to go. Harry heard something creak outside. He hoped the roof wasn't going to fall in, although he might be warmer if it did. 
691 
692 Four minutes to go. Maybe the house in Privet Drive would be so full of letters when they got back that he'd be able to steal one somehow. 
693 
694 Three minutes to go. Was that the sea, slapping hard on the rock like that? And (two minutes to go) what was that funny crunching noise? Was the rock crumbling into the sea? One minute to go and he'd be eleven. Thirty seconds... twenty ... ten... 
695 
696 nine -- maybe he'd wake Dudley up, just to annoy him -- three... two... 
697 
698 one... 
699 
700 BOOM. 
701 
702 The whole shack shivered and Harry sat bolt upright, staring at the door. Someone was outside, knocking to come in. 
703 
704 CHAPTER FOUR 
705 
706 THE KEEPER OF THE KEYS 
707 
708 BOOM. They knocked again. Dudley jerked awake. "Where's the cannon?" he said stupidly. 
709 
710 There was a crash behind them and Uncle Vernon came skidding into the room. He was holding a rifle in his hands -- now they knew what had been in the long, thin package he had brought with them. 
711 
712 "Who's there?" he shouted. "I warn you -- I'm armed!" 
713 
714 There was a pause. Then � 
715 
716 SMASH! 
717 
718 The door was hit with such force that it swung clean off its hinges and with a deafening crash landed flat on the floor. 
719 
720 A giant of a man was standing in the doorway. His face was almost completely hidden by a long, shaggy mane of hair and a wild, tangled beard, but you could make out his eyes, glinting like black beetles under all the hair. 
721 
722 The giant squeezed his way into the hut, stooping so that his head just brushed the ceiling. He bent down, picked up the door, and fitted it easily back into its frame. The noise of the storm outside dropped a little. He turned to look at them all. 
723 
724 "Couldn't make us a cup o' tea, could yeh? It's not been an easy journey..." 
725 
726 He strode over to the sofa where Dudley sat frozen with fear. 
727 
728 "Budge up, yeh great lump," said the stranger. 
729 
730 Dudley squeaked and ran to hide behind his mother, who was crouching, terrified, behind Uncle Vernon. 
731 
732 "An' here's Harry!" said the giant. 
733 
734 Harry looked up into the fierce, wild, shadowy face and saw that the beetle eyes were crinkled in a smile. 
735 
736 "Las' time I saw you, you was only a baby," said the giant. "Yeh look a lot like yet dad, but yeh've got yet mom's eyes." 
737 
738 Uncle Vernon made a funny rasping noise. 
739 
740 I demand that you leave at once, sit!" he said. "You are breaking and entering!" 
741 
742 "Ah, shut up, Dursley, yeh great prune," said the giant; he reached over the back of the sofa, jerked the gun out of Uncle Vernon's hands, bent it into a knot as easily as if it had been made of rubber, and threw it into a corner of the room. 
743 
744 Uncle Vernon made another funny noise, like a mouse being trodden on. 
745 
746 "Anyway -- Harry," said the giant, turning his back on the Dursleys, "a very happy birthday to yeh. Got summat fer yeh here -- I mighta sat on it at some point, but it'll taste all right." 
747 
748 From an inside pocket of his black overcoat he pulled a slightly squashed box. Harry opened it with trembling fingers. Inside was a large, sticky chocolate cake with Happy Birthday Harry written on it in green icing. 
749 
750 Harry looked up at the giant. He meant to say thank you, but the words got lost on the way to his mouth, and what he said instead was, "Who are you?" 
751 
752 The giant chuckled. 
753 
754 "True, I haven't introduced meself. Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts." 
755 
756 He held out an enormous hand and shook Harry's whole arm. 
757 
758 "What about that tea then, eh?" he said, rubbing his hands together. 
759 
760 "I'd not say no ter summat stronger if yeh've got it, mind." 
761 
762 His eyes fell on the empty grate with the shriveled chip bags in it and he snorted. He bent down over the fireplace; they couldn't see what he was doing but when he drew back a second later, there was a roaring fire there. It filled the whole damp hut with flickering light and Harry felt the warmth wash over him as though he'd sunk into a hot bath. 
763 
764 The giant sat back down on the sofa, which sagged under his weight, and began taking all sorts of things out of the pockets of his coat: a copper kettle, a squashy package of sausages, a poker, a teapot, several chipped mugs, and a bottle of some amber liquid that he took a swig from before starting to make tea. Soon the hut was full of the sound and smell of sizzling sausage. Nobody said a thing while the giant was working, but as he slid the first six fat, juicy, slightly burnt sausages from the poker, Dudley fidgeted a little. Uncle Vernon said sharply, "Don't touch anything he gives you, Dudley." 
765 
766 The giant chuckled darkly. 
767 
768 "Yet great puddin' of a son don' need fattenin' anymore, Dursley, don' worry." 
769 
770 He passed the sausages to Harry, who was so hungry he had never tasted anything so wonderful, but he still couldn't take his eyes off the giant. Finally, as nobody seemed about to explain anything, he said, "I'm sorry, but I still don't really know who you are." 
771 
772 The giant took a gulp of tea and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. 
773 
774 "Call me Hagrid," he said, "everyone does. An' like I told yeh, I'm Keeper of Keys at Hogwarts -- yeh'll know all about Hogwarts, o' course. 
775 
776 "Er -- no," said Harry. 
777 
778 Hagrid looked shocked. 
779 
780 "Sorry," Harry said quickly. 
781 
782 "Sony?" barked Hagrid, turning to stare at the Dursleys, who shrank back into the shadows. "It' s them as should be sorry! I knew yeh weren't gettin' yer letters but I never thought yeh wouldn't even know abou' Hogwarts, fer cryin' out loud! Did yeh never wonder where yet parents learned it all?" 
783 
784 "All what?" asked Harry. 
785 
786 "ALL WHAT?" Hagrid thundered. "Now wait jus' one second!" 
787 
788 He had leapt to his feet. In his anger he seemed to fill the whole hut. 
789 
790 The Dursleys were cowering against the wall. 
791 
792 "Do you mean ter tell me," he growled at the Dursleys, "that this boy -- this boy! -- knows nothin' abou' -- about ANYTHING?" 
793 
794 Harry thought this was going a bit far. He had been to school, after all, and his marks weren't bad. 
795 
796 "I know some things," he said. "I can, you know, do math and stuff." But Hagrid simply waved his hand and said, "About our world, I mean. Your world. My world. Yer parents' world." 
797 
798 "What world?" 
799 
800 Hagrid looked as if he was about to explode. 
801 
802 "DURSLEY!" he boomed. 
803 
804 Uncle Vernon, who had gone very pale, whispered something that sounded like "Mimblewimble." Hagrid stared wildly at Harry. 
805 
806 "But yeh must know about yet mom and dad," he said. "I mean, they're famous. You're famous." 
807 
808 "What? My -- my mom and dad weren't famous, were they?" 
809 
810 "Yeh don' know... yeh don' know..." Hagrid ran his fingers through his hair, fixing Harry with a bewildered stare. 
811 
812 "Yeh don' know what yeh are?" he said finally. 
813 
814 Uncle Vernon suddenly found his voice. 
815 
816 "Stop!" he commanded. "Stop right there, sit! I forbid you to tell the boy anything!" 
817 
818 A braver man than Vernon Dursley would have quailed under the furious look Hagrid now gave him; when Hagrid spoke, his every syllable trembled with rage. 
819 
820 "You never told him? Never told him what was in the letter Dumbledore left fer him? I was there! I saw Dumbledore leave it, Dursley! An' you've kept it from him all these years?" 
821 
822 "Kept what from me?" said Harry eagerly. 
823 
824 "STOP! I FORBID YOU!" yelled Uncle Vernon in panic. 
825 
826 Aunt Petunia gave a gasp of horror. 
827 
828 "Ah, go boil yet heads, both of yeh," said Hagrid. "Harry -- yet a wizard." 
829 
830 There was silence inside the hut. Only the sea and the whistling wind could be heard. 
831 
832 "-- a what?" gasped Harry. 
833 
834 "A wizard, o' course," said Hagrid, sitting back down on the sofa, which groaned and sank even lower, "an' a thumpin' good'un, I'd say, once yeh've been trained up a bit. With a mum an' dad like yours, what else would yeh be? An' I reckon it's abou' time yeh read yer letter." 
835 
836 Harry stretched out his hand at last to take the yellowish envelope, addressed in emerald green to Mr. H. Potter, The Floor, Hut-on-the-Rock, The Sea. He pulled out the letter and read: HOGWARTS SCHOOL of WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY Headmaster: ALBUS DUMBLEDORE (Order of Merlin, First Class, Grand Sorc., Chf. Warlock, Supreme Mugwump, International Confed. of Wizards) Dear Mr. Potter, We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment. 
837 
838 Term begins on September 1. We await your owl by no later than July 31. 
839 
840 Yours sincerely, Minerva McGonagall, Deputy Headmistress Questions exploded inside Harry's head like fireworks and he couldn't decide which to ask first. After a few minutes he stammered, "What does it mean, they await my owl?" 
841 
842 "Gallopin' Gorgons, that reminds me," said Hagrid, clapping a hand to his forehead with enough force to knock over a cart horse, and from yet another pocket inside his overcoat he pulled an owl -- a real, live, rather ruffled-looking owl -- a long quill, and a roll of parchment. 
843 
844 With his tongue between his teeth he scribbled a note that Harry could read upside down: Dear Professor Dumbledore, Given Harry his letter. 
845 
846 Taking him to buy his things tomorrow. 
847 
848 Weather's horrible. Hope you're Well. 
849 
850 Hagrid Hagrid rolled up the note, gave it to the owl, which clamped it in its beak, went to the door, and threw the owl out into the storm. Then he came back and sat down as though this was as normal as talking on the telephone. 
851 
852 Harry realized his mouth was open and closed it quickly. 
853 
854 "Where was I?" said Hagrid, but at that moment, Uncle Vernon, still ashen-faced but looking very angry, moved into the firelight. 
855 
856 "He's not going," he said. 
857 
858 Hagrid grunted. 
859 
860 "I'd like ter see a great Muggle like you stop him," he said. 
861 
862 "A what?" said Harry, interested. 
863 
864 "A Muggle," said Hagrid, "it's what we call nonmagic folk like thern. 
865 
866 An' it's your bad luck you grew up in a family o' the biggest Muggles I ever laid eyes on." 
867 
868 "We swore when we took him in we'd put a stop to that rubbish," said Uncle Vernon, "swore we'd stamp it out of him! Wizard indeed!" 
869 
870 "You knew?" said Harry. "You knew I'm a -- a wizard?" 
871 
872 "Knew!" shrieked Aunt Petunia suddenly. "Knew! Of course we knew! How could you not be, my dratted sister being what she was? Oh, she got a letter just like that and disappeared off to that-that school-and came home every vacation with her pockets full of frog spawn, turning teacups into rats. I was the only one who saw her for what she was -- a freak! But for my mother and father, oh no, it was Lily this and Lily that, they were proud of having a witch in the family!" 
873 
874 She stopped to draw a deep breath and then went ranting on. It seemed she had been wanting to say all this for years. 
875 
876 "Then she met that Potter at school and they left and got married and had you, and of course I knew you'd be just the same, just as strange, just as -- as -- abnormal -- and then, if you please, she went and got herself blown up and we got landed with you!" 
877 
878 Harry had gone very white. As soon as he found his voice he said, "Blown up? You told me they died in a car crash!" 
879 
880 "CAR CRASH!" roared Hagrid, jumping up so angrily that the Dursleys scuttled back to their corner. "How could a car crash kill Lily an' James Potter? It's an outrage! A scandal! Harry Potter not knowin' his own story when every kid in our world knows his name!" "But why? What happened?" Harry asked urgently. 
881 
882 The anger faded from Hagrid's face. He looked suddenly anxious. 
883 
884 "I never expected this," he said, in a low, worried voice. "I had no idea, when Dumbledore told me there might be trouble gettin' hold of yeh, how much yeh didn't know. Ah, Harry, I don' know if I'm the right person ter tell yeh -- but someone 3 s gotta -- yeh can't go off ter Hogwarts not knowin'." 
885 
886 He threw a dirty look at the Dursleys. 
887 
888 "Well, it's best yeh know as much as I can tell yeh -- mind, I can't tell yeh everythin', it's a great myst'ry, parts of it...." 
889 
890 He sat down, stared into the fire for a few seconds, and then said, "It begins, I suppose, with -- with a person called -- but it's incredible yeh don't know his name, everyone in our world knows --" 
891 
892 "Who? � 
893 
894 "Well -- I don' like sayin' the name if I can help it. No one does." 
895 
896 "Why not?" 
897 
898 "Gulpin' gargoyles, Harry, people are still scared. Blimey, this is difficult. See, there was this wizard who went... bad. As bad as you could go. Worse. Worse than worse. His name was..." 
899 
900 Hagrid gulped, but no words came out. 
901 
902 "Could you write it down?" Harry suggested. 
903 
904 "Nah -can't spell it. All right -- Voldemort. " Hagrid shuddered. "Don' make me say it again. Anyway, this -- this wizard, about twenty years ago now, started lookin' fer followers. Got 'em, too -- some were afraid, some just wanted a bit o' his power, 'cause he was gettin' himself power, all right. Dark days, Harry. Didn't know who ter trust, didn't dare get friendly with strange wizards or witches... terrible things happened. He was takin' over. 'Course, some stood up to him -- an' he killed 'em. Horribly. One o' the only safe places left was Hogwarts. Reckon Dumbledore's the only one You-Know-Who was afraid of. 
905 
906 Didn't dare try takin' the school, not jus' then, anyway. 
907 
908 "Now, yer mum an' dad were as good a witch an' wizard as I ever knew. 
909 
910 Head boy an' girl at Hogwarts in their day! Suppose the myst'ry is why You-Know-Who never tried to get 'em on his side before... probably knew they were too close ter Dumbledore ter want anythin' ter do with the Dark Side. 
911 
912 "Maybe he thought he could persuade 'em... maybe he just wanted 'em outta the way. All anyone knows is, he turned up in the village where you was all living, on Halloween ten years ago. You was just a year old. 
913 
914 He came ter yer house an' -- an' --" 
915 
916 Hagrid suddenly pulled out a very dirty, spotted handkerchief and blew his nose with a sound like a foghorn. 
917 
918 "Sorry," he said. "But it's that sad -- knew yer mum an' dad, an' nicer people yeh couldn't find -- anyway..." 
919 
920 "You-Know-Who killed 'em. An' then -- an' this is the real myst'ry of the thing -- he tried to kill you, too. Wanted ter make a clean job of it, I suppose, or maybe he just liked killin' by then. But he couldn't do it. Never wondered how you got that mark on yer forehead? That was no ordinary cut. That's what yeh get when a Powerful, evil curse touches yeh -- took care of yer mum an' dad an' yer house, even -- but it didn't work on you, an' that's why yer famous, Harry. No one ever lived after he decided ter kill 'em, no one except you, an' he'd killed some o' the best witches an' wizards of the age -- the McKinnons, the Bones, the Prewetts -- an' you was only a baby, an' you lived." 
921 
922 Something very painful was going on in Harry's mind. As Hagrid's story came to a close, he saw again the blinding flash of green light, more clearly than he had ever remembered it before -- and he remembered something else, for the first time in his life: a high, cold, cruel laugh. 
923 
924 Hagrid was watching him sadly. 
925 
926 "Took yeh from the ruined house myself, on Dumbledore's orders. Brought yeh ter this lot..." 
927 
928 "Load of old tosh," said Uncle Vernon. Harry jumped; he had almost forgotten that the Dursleys were there. Uncle Vernon certainly seemed to have got back his courage. He was glaring at Hagrid and his fists were clenched. 
929 
930 "Now, you listen here, boy," he snarled, "I accept there's something strange about you, probably nothing a good beating wouldn't have cured -- and as for all this about your parents, well, they were weirdos, no denying it, and the world's better off without them in my opinion -- asked for all they got, getting mixed up with these wizarding types -- just what I expected, always knew they'd come to a sticky end --" 
931 
932 But at that moment, Hagrid leapt from the sofa and drew a battered pink umbrella from inside his coat. Pointing this at Uncle Vernon like a sword, he said, "I'm warning you, Dursley -I'm warning you -- one more word... � 
933 
934 In danger of being speared on the end of an umbrella by a bearded giant, Uncle Vernon's courage failed again; he flattened himself against the wall and fell silent. 
935 
936 "That's better," said Hagrid, breathing heavily and sitting back down on the sofa, which this time sagged right down to the floor. 
937 
938 Harry, meanwhile, still had questions to ask, hundreds of them. 
939 
940 "But what happened to Vol--, sorry -- I mean, You-Know-Who?" 
941 
942 "Good question, Harry. Disappeared. Vanished. Same night he tried ter kill you. Makes yeh even more famous. That's the biggest myst'ry, see... 
943 
944 he was gettin' more an' more powerful -- why'd he go? "Some say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he had enough human left in him to die. Some say he's still out there, bidin' his time, like, but I don' believe it. People who was on his side came back ter ours. Some of 'em came outta kinda trances. Don~ reckon they could've done if he was comin' back. 
945 
946 "Most of us reckon he's still out there somewhere but lost his powers. 
947 
948 Too weak to carry on. 'Cause somethin' about you finished him, Harry. 
949 
950 There was somethin' goin' on that night he hadn't counted on -- I dunno what it was, no one does -- but somethin' about you stumped him, all right." 
951 
952 Hagrid looked at Harry with warmth and respect blazing in his eyes, but Harry, instead of feeling pleased and proud, felt quite sure there had been a horrible mistake. A wizard? Him? How could he possibly be? He'd spent his life being clouted by Dudley, and bullied by Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon; if he was really a wizard, why hadn't they been turned into warty toads every time they'd tried to lock him in his cupboard? If he'd once defeated the greatest sorcerer in the world, how come Dudley had always been able to kick him around like a football? "Hagrid," he said quietly, "I think you must have made a mistake. I don't think I can be a wizard." 
953 
954 To his surprise, Hagrid chuckled. 
955 
956 "Not a wizard, eh? Never made things happen when you was scared or angry?" 
957 
958 Harry looked into the fire. Now he came to think about it... every odd thing that had ever made his aunt and uncle furious with him had happened when he, Harry, had been upset or angry... chased by Dudley's gang, he had somehow found himself out of their reach... dreading going to school with that ridiculous haircut, he'd managed to make it grow back... and the very last time Dudley had hit him, hadn't he got his revenge, without even realizing he was doing it? Hadn't he set a boa constrictor on him? Harry looked back at Hagrid, smiling, and saw that Hagrid was positively beaming at him. 
959 
960 "See?" said Hagrid. "Harry Potter, not a wizard -- you wait, you'll be right famous at Hogwarts." 
961 
962 But Uncle Vernon wasn't going to give in without a fight. 
963 
964 "Haven't I told you he's not going?" he hissed. "He's going to Stonewall High and he'll be grateful for it. I've read those letters and he needs all sorts of rubbish -- spell books and wands and --" 
965 
966 "If he wants ter go, a great Muggle like you won't stop him," growled Hagrid. "Stop Lily an' James Potter' s son goin' ter Hogwarts! Yer mad. 
967 
968 His name's been down ever since he was born. He's off ter the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world. Seven years there and he won't know himself. He'll be with youngsters of his own sort, fer a change, an' he'll be under the greatest headmaster Hogwarts ever had Albus Dumbled--" 
969 
970 "I AM NOT PAYING FOR SOME CRACKPOT OLD FOOL To TEACH HIM MAGIC TRICKS!" 
971 
972 yelled Uncle Vernon. 
973 
974 But he had finally gone too far. Hagrid seized his umbrella and whirled it over his head, "NEVER," he thundered, "- INSULT- ALBUS- DUMBLEDOREIN- FRONT- OF- ME!" 
975 
976 He brought the umbrella swishing down through the air to point at Dudley -- there was a flash of violet light, a sound like a firecracker, a sharp squeal, and the next second, Dudley was dancing on the spot with his hands clasped over his fat bottom, howling in pain. When he turned his back on them, Harry saw a curly pig's tail poking through a hole in his trousers. 
977 
978 Uncle Vernon roared. Pulling Aunt Petunia and Dudley into the other room, he cast one last terrified look at Hagrid and slammed the door behind them. 
979 
980 Hagrid looked down at his umbrella and stroked his beard. 
981 
982 "Shouldn'ta lost me temper," he said ruefully, "but it didn't work anyway. Meant ter turn him into a pig, but I suppose he was so much like a pig anyway there wasn't much left ter do." 
983 
984 He cast a sideways look at Harry under his bushy eyebrows. 
985 
986 "Be grateful if yeh didn't mention that ter anyone at Hogwarts," he said. "I'm -- er -- not supposed ter do magic, strictly speakin'. I was allowed ter do a bit ter follow yeh an' get yer letters to yeh an' stuff -- one o' the reasons I was so keen ter take on the job "Why aren't you supposed to do magic?" asked Harry. 
987 
988 "Oh, well -- I was at Hogwarts meself but I -- er -- got expelled, ter tell yeh the truth. In me third year. They snapped me wand in half an' everything. But Dumbledore let me stay on as gamekeeper. Great man, Dumbledore." "Why were you expelled?" 
989 
990 "It's gettin' late and we've got lots ter do tomorrow," said Hagrid loudly. "Gotta get up ter town, get all yer books an' that." 
991 
992 He took off his thick black coat and threw it to Harry. 
993 
994 "You can kip under that," he said. "Don' mind if it wriggles a bit, I think I still got a couple o' dormice in one o' the pockets." 
995 
996 CHAPTER FIVE 
997 
998 DIAGON ALLEY 
999 
1000 Harry woke early the next morning. Although he could tell it was daylight, he kept his eyes shut tight. 
1001 
1002 "It was a dream, he told himself firmly. "I dreamed a giant called Hagrid came to tell me I was going to a school for wizards. When I open my eyes I'll be at home in my cupboard." 
1003 
1004 There was suddenly a loud tapping noise. 
1005 
1006 And there's Aunt Petunia knocking on the door, Harry thought, his heart sinking. But he still didn't open his eyes. It had been such a good dream. 
1007 
1008 Tap. Tap. Tap. 
1009 
1010 "All right," Harry mumbled, "I'm getting up." 
1011 
1012 He sat up and Hagrid's heavy coat fell off him. The hut was full of sunlight, the storm was over, Hagrid himself was asleep on the collapsed sofa, and there was an owl rapping its claw on the window, a newspaper held in its beak. 
1013 
1014 Harry scrambled to his feet, so happy he felt as though a large balloon was swelling inside him. He went straight to the window and jerked it open. The owl swooped in and dropped the newspaper on top of Hagrid, who didn't wake up. The owl then fluttered onto the floor and began to attack Hagrid's coat. 
1015 
1016 "Don't do that." 
1017 
1018 Harry tried to wave the owl out of the way, but it snapped its beak fiercely at him and carried on savaging the coat. 
1019 
1020 "Hagrid!" said Harry loudly. "There's an owl "Pay him," Hagrid grunted into the sofa. 
1021 
1022 "What?" 
1023 
1024 "He wants payin' fer deliverin' the paper. Look in the pockets." 
1025 
1026 Hagrid's coat seemed to be made of nothing but pockets -- bunches of keys, slug pellets, balls of string, peppermint humbugs, teabags... 
1027 
1028 finally, Harry pulled out a handful of strange-looking coins. 
1029 
1030 "Give him five Knuts," said Hagrid sleepily. 
1031 
1032 "Knuts?" 
1033 
1034 "The little bronze ones." 
1035 
1036 Harry counted out five little bronze coins, and the owl held out his leg so Harry could put the money into a small leather pouch tied to it. Then he flew off through the open window. 
1037 
1038 Hagrid yawned loudly, sat up, and stretched. 
1039 
1040 "Best be Off, Harry, lots ter do today, gotta get up ter London an' buy all yer stuff fer school." 
1041 
1042 Harry was turning over the wizard coins and looking at them. He had just thought of something that made him feel as though the happy balloon inside him had got a puncture. 
1043 
1044 "Um -- Hagrid?" 
1045 
1046 "Mm?" said Hagrid, who was pulling on his huge boots. 
1047 
1048 "I haven't got any money -- and you heard Uncle Vernon last night ... he won't pay for me to go and learn magic." 
1049 
1050 "Don't worry about that," said Hagrid, standing up and scratching his head. "D'yeh think yer parents didn't leave yeh anything?" 
1051 
1052 "But if their house was destroyed --" 
1053 
1054 "They didn' keep their gold in the house, boy! Nah, first stop fer us is Gringotts. Wizards' bank. Have a sausage, they're not bad cold -- an' I wouldn' say no teh a bit o' yer birthday cake, neither." 
1055 
1056 "Wizards have banks?" 
1057 
1058 "Just the one. Gringotts. Run by goblins." 
1059 
1060 Harry dropped the bit of sausage he was holding. 
1061 
1062 "Goblins?" 
1063 
1064 "Yeah -- so yeh'd be mad ter try an' rob it, I'll tell yeh that. Never mess with goblins, Harry. Gringotts is the safest place in the world fer anything yeh want ter keep safe -- 'cept maybe Hogwarts. As a matter o' fact, I gotta visit Gringotts anyway. Fer Dumbledore. Hogwarts business." Hagrid drew himself up proudly. "He usually gets me ter do important stuff fer him. Fetchin' you gettin' things from Gringotts -- knows he can trust me, see. 
1065 
1066 "Got everythin'? Come on, then." 
1067 
1068 Harry followed Hagrid out onto the rock. The sky was quite clear now and the sea gleamed in the sunlight. The boat Uncle Vernon had hired was still there, with a lot of water in the bottom after the storm. 
1069 
1070 "How did you get here?" Harry asked, looking around for another boat. 
1071 
1072 "Flew," said Hagrid. 
1073 
1074 "Flew?" 
1075 
1076 "Yeah -- but we'll go back in this. Not s'pposed ter use magic now I've got yeh." 
1077 
1078 They settled down in the boat, Harry still staring at Hagrid, trying to imagine him flying. 
1079 
1080 "Seems a shame ter row, though," said Hagrid, giving Harry another of his sideways looks. "If I was ter -- er -- speed things up a bit, would yeh mind not mentionin' it at Hogwarts?" 
1081 
1082 "Of course not," said Harry, eager to see more magic. Hagrid pulled out the pink umbrella again, tapped it twice on the side of the boat, and they sped off toward land. 
1083 
1084 "Why would you be mad to try and rob Gringotts?" Harry asked. 
1085 
1086 "Spells -- enchantments," said Hagrid, unfolding his newspaper as he spoke. "They say there's dragons guardin' the highsecurity vaults. And then yeh gotta find yer way -- Gringotts is hundreds of miles under London, see. Deep under the Underground. Yeh'd die of hunger tryin' ter get out, even if yeh did manage ter get yer hands on summat." 
1087 
1088 Harry sat and thought about this while Hagrid read his newspaper, the Daily Prophet. Harry had learned from Uncle Vernon that people liked to be left alone while they did this, but it was very difficult, he'd never had so many questions in his life. 
1089 
1090 "Ministry o' Magic messin' things up as usual," Hagrid muttered, turning the page. 
1091 
1092 "There's a Ministry of Magic?" Harry asked, before he could stop himself. 
1093 
1094 "'Course," said Hagrid. "They wanted Dumbledore fer Minister, 0 ' course, but he'd never leave Hogwarts, so old Cornelius Fudge got the job. Bungler if ever there was one. So he pelts Dumbledore with owls every morning, askin' fer advice." 
1095 
1096 "But what does a Ministry of Magic do?" 
1097 
1098 "Well, their main job is to keep it from the Muggles that there's still witches an' wizards up an' down the country." 
1099 
1100 "Why?" 
1101 
1102 "Why? Blimey, Harry, everyone'd be wantin' magic solutions to their problems. Nah, we're best left alone." 
1103 
1104 At this moment the boat bumped gently into the harbor wall. Hagrid folded up his newspaper, and they clambered up the stone steps onto the street. 
1105 
1106 Passersby stared a lot at Hagrid as they walked through the little town to the station. Harry couldn't blame them. Not only was Hagrid twice as tall as anyone else, he kept pointing at perfectly ordinary things like parking meters and saying loudly, "See that, Harry? Things these Muggles dream up, eh?" 
1107 
1108 "Hagrid," said Harry, panting a bit as he ran to keep up, "did you say there are dragons at Gringotts?" 
1109 
1110 "Well, so they say," said Hagrid. "Crikey, I'd like a dragon." 
1111 
1112 "You'd like one?" 
1113 
1114 "Wanted one ever since I was a kid -- here we go." 
1115 
1116 They had reached the station. There was a train to London in five minutes' time. Hagrid, who didn't understand "Muggle money," as he called it, gave the bills to Harry so he could buy their tickets. 
1117 
1118 People stared more than ever on the train. Hagrid took up two seats and sat knitting what looked like a canary-yellow circus tent. 
1119 
1120 "Still got yer letter, Harry?" he asked as he counted stitches. Harry took the parchment envelope out of his pocket. 
1121 
1122 "Good," said Hagrid. "There's a list there of everything yeh need." 
1123 
1124 Harry unfolded a second piece of paper he hadn't noticed the night before, and read: HOGWARTS SCHOOL of WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY UNIFORM First-year students will require: 1. Three sets of plain work robes (black) 2. One plain pointed hat (black) for day wear 3. One pair of protective gloves (dragon hide or similar) 4. One winter cloak (black, silver fastenings) Please note that all pupils' clothes should carry name tags COURSE BOOKS All students should have a copy of each of the following: The Standard Book of Spells (Grade 1) by Miranda Goshawk A History of Magic by Bathilda Bagshot Magical Theory by Adalbert Waffling A Beginners' Guide to Transfiguration by Emetic Switch One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi by Phyllida Spore Magical Drafts and Potions by Arsenius Jigger Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them by Newt Scamander The Dark Forces: A Guide to Self-Protection by Quentin Trimble OTHER EQUIPMENT wand cauldron (pewter, standard size 2) set glass or crystal phials telescope set brass scales Students may also bring an owl OR a cat OR a toad PARENTS ARE REMINDED THAT FIRST YEARS ARE NOT ALLOWED THEIR OWN BROOMSTICKS "Can we buy all this in London?" Harry wondered aloud. 
1125 
1126 "If yeh know where to go," said Hagrid. 
1127 
1128 Harry had never been to London before. Although Hagrid seemed to know where he was going, he was obviously not used to getting there in an ordinary way. He got stuck in the ticket barrier on the Underground, and complained loudly that the seats were too small and the trains too slow. 
1129 
1130 "I don't know how the Muggles manage without magic," he said as they climbed a broken-down escalator that led up to a bustling road lined with shops. 
1131 
1132 Hagrid was so huge that he parted the crowd easily; all Harry had to do was keep close behind him. They passed book shops and music stores, hamburger restaurants and cinemas, but nowhere that looked as if it could sell you a magic wand. This was just an ordinary street full of ordinary people. Could there really be piles of wizard gold buried miles beneath them? Were there really shops that sold spell books and broomsticks? Might this not all be some huge joke that the Dursleys had cooked up? If Harry hadn't known that the Dursleys had no sense of humor, he might have thought so; yet somehow, even though everything Hagrid had told him so far was unbelievable, Harry couldn't help trusting him. 
1133 
1134 "This is it," said Hagrid, coming to a halt, "the Leaky Cauldron. It's a famous place." 
1135 
1136 It was a tiny, grubby-looking pub. If Hagrid hadn't pointed it out, Harry wouldn't have noticed it was there. The people hurrying by didn't glance at it. Their eyes slid from the big book shop on one side to the record shop on the other as if they couldn't see the Leaky Cauldron at all. In fact, Harry had the most peculiar feeling that only he and Hagrid could see it. Before he could mention this, Hagrid had steered him inside. 
1137 
1138 For a famous place, it was very dark and shabby. A few old women were sitting in a corner, drinking tiny glasses of sherry. One of them was smoking a long pipe. A little man in a top hat was talking to the old bartender, who was quite bald and looked like a toothless walnut. The low buzz of chatter stopped when they walked in. Everyone seemed to know Hagrid; they waved and smiled at him, and the bartender reached for a glass, saying, "The usual, Hagrid?" 
1139 
1140 "Can't, Tom, I'm on Hogwarts business," said Hagrid, clapping his great hand on Harry's shoulder and making Harry's knees buckle. 
1141 
1142 "Good Lord," said the bartender, peering at Harry, "is this -- can this be --?" 
1143 
1144 The Leaky Cauldron had suddenly gone completely still and silent. 
1145 
1146 "Bless my soul," whispered the old bartender, "Harry Potter... what an honor." 
1147 
1148 He hurried out from behind the bar, rushed toward Harry and seized his hand, tears in his eyes. 
1149 
1150 "Welcome back, Mr. Potter, welcome back." 
1151 
1152 Harry didn't know what to say. Everyone was looking at him. The old woman with the pipe was puffing on it without realizing it had gone out. 
1153 
1154 Hagrid was beaming. 
1155 
1156 Then there was a great scraping of chairs and the next moment, Harry found himself shaking hands with everyone in the Leaky Cauldron. 
1157 
1158 "Doris Crockford, Mr. Potter, can't believe I'm meeting you at last." 
1159 
1160 "So proud, Mr. Potter, I'm just so proud." 
1161 
1162 "Always wanted to shake your hand -- I'm all of a flutter." 
1163 
1164 "Delighted, Mr. Potter, just can't tell you, Diggle's the name, Dedalus Diggle." 
1165 
1166 "I've seen you before!" said Harry, as Dedalus Diggle's top hat fell off in his excitement. "You bowed to me once in a shop." 
1167 
1168 "He remembers!" cried Dedalus Diggle, looking around at everyone. "Did you hear that? He remembers me!" Harry shook hands again and again -- Doris Crockford kept coming back for more. 
1169 
1170 A pale young man made his way forward, very nervously. One of his eyes was twitching. 
1171 
1172 "Professor Quirrell!" said Hagrid. "Harry, Professor Quirrell will be one of your teachers at Hogwarts." 
1173 
1174 "P-P-Potter," stammered Professor Quirrell, grasping Harry's hand, "c-can't t-tell you how p- pleased I am to meet you." 
1175 
1176 "What sort of magic do you teach, Professor Quirrell?" 
1177 
1178 "D-Defense Against the D-D-Dark Arts," muttered Professor Quirrell, as though he'd rather not think about it. "N-not that you n-need it, eh, P-P-Potter?" He laughed nervously. "You'll be g-getting all your equipment, I suppose? I've g-got to p-pick up a new b-book on vampires, m-myself." He looked terrified at the very thought. 
1179 
1180 But the others wouldn't let Professor Quirrell keep Harry to himself. It took almost ten minutes to get away from them all. At last, Hagrid managed to make himself heard over the babble. 
1181 
1182 "Must get on -- lots ter buy. Come on, Harry." 
1183 
1184 Doris Crockford shook Harry's hand one last time, and Hagrid led them through the bar and out into a small, walled courtyard, where there was nothing but a trash can and a few weeds. 
1185 
1186 Hagrid grinned at Harry. 
1187 
1188 "Told yeh, didn't I? Told yeh you was famous. Even Professor Quirrell was tremblin' ter meet yeh -- mind you, he's usually tremblin'." 
1189 
1190 "Is he always that nervous?" 
1191 
1192 "Oh, yeah. Poor bloke. Brilliant mind. He was fine while he was studyin' outta books but then he took a year off ter get some firsthand experience.... They say he met vampires in the Black Forest, and there was a nasty bit o' trouble with a hag -- never been the same since. 
1193 
1194 Scared of the students, scared of his own subject now, where's me umbrella?" 
1195 
1196 Vampires? Hags? Harry's head was swimming. Hagrid, meanwhile, was counting bricks in the wall above the trash can. 
1197 
1198 "Three up... two across he muttered. "Right, stand back, Harry." 
1199 
1200 He tapped the wall three times with the point of his umbrella. 
1201 
1202 The brick he had touched quivered -- it wriggled -- in the middle, a small hole appeared -- it grew wider and wider -- a second later they were facing an archway large enough even for Hagrid, an archway onto a cobbled street that twisted and turned out of sight. 
1203 
1204 "Welcome," said Hagrid, "to Diagon Alley." 
1205 
1206 He grinned at Harry's amazement. They stepped through the archway. Harry looked quickly over his shoulder and saw the archway shrink instantly back into solid wall. 
1207 
1208 The sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons outside the nearest shop. 
1209 
1210 Cauldrons -- All Sizes - Copper, Brass, Pewter, Silver -- Self-Stirring -- Collapsible, said a sign hanging over them. 
1211 
1212 "Yeah, you'll be needin' one," said Hagrid, "but we gotta get yer money first." 
1213 
1214 Harry wished he had about eight more eyes. He turned his head in every direction as they walked up the street, trying to look at everything at once: the shops, the things outside them, the people doing their shopping. A plump woman outside an Apothecary was shaking her head as they passed, saying, "Dragon liver, seventeen Sickles an ounce, they're mad...." 
1215 
1216 A low, soft hooting came from a dark shop with a sign saying Eeylops Owl Emporium -- Tawny, Screech, Barn, Brown, and Snowy. Several boys of about Harry's age had their noses pressed against a window with broomsticks in it. "Look," Harry heard one of them say, "the new Nimbus Two Thousand -- fastest ever --" There were shops selling robes, shops selling telescopes and strange silver instruments Harry had never seen before, windows stacked with barrels of bat spleens and eels' eyes, tottering piles of spell books, quills, and rolls of parchment, potion bottles, globes of the moon.... 
1217 
1218 "Gringotts," said Hagrid. 
1219 
1220 They had reached a snowy white building that towered over the other little shops. Standing beside its burnished bronze doors, wearing a uniform of scarlet and gold, was - "Yeah, that's a goblin," said Hagrid quietly as they walked up the white stone steps toward him. The goblin was about a head shorter than Harry. 
1221 
1222 He had a swarthy, clever face, a pointed beard and, Harry noticed, very long fingers and feet. He bowed as they walked inside. Now they were facing a second pair of doors, silver this time, with words engraved upon them: Enter, stranger, but take heed Of what awaits the sin of greed, For those who take, but do not earn, Must pay most dearly in their turn. 
1223 
1224 So if you seek beneath our floors A treasure that was never yours, Thief, you have been warned, beware Of finding more than treasure there. 
1225 
1226 "Like I said, Yeh'd be mad ter try an' rob it," said Hagrid. 
1227 
1228 A pair of goblins bowed them through the silver doors and they were in a vast marble hall. About a hundred more goblins were sitting on high stools behind a long counter, scribbling in large ledgers, weighing coins in brass scales, examining precious stones through eyeglasses. 
1229 
1230 There were too many doors to count leading off the hall, and yet more goblins were showing people in and out of these. Hagrid and Harry made for the counter. 
1231 
1232 "Morning," said Hagrid to a free goblin. "We've come ter take some money outta Mr. Harry Potter's safe." 
1233 
1234 "You have his key, Sir?" 
1235 
1236 "Got it here somewhere," said Hagrid, and he started emptying his pockets onto the counter, scattering a handful of moldy dog biscuits over the goblin's book of numbers. The goblin wrinkled his nose. Harry watched the goblin on their right weighing a pile of rubies as big as glowing coals. 
1237 
1238 "Got it," said Hagrid at last, holding up a tiny golden key. 
1239 
1240 The goblin looked at it closely. 
1241 
1242 "That seems to be in order." 
1243 
1244 "An' I've also got a letter here from Professor Dumbledore," said Hagrid importantly, throwing out his chest. "It's about the YouKnow-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen." 
1245 
1246 The goblin read the letter carefully. 
1247 
1248 "Very well," he said, handing it back to Hagrid, "I will have Someone take you down to both vaults. Griphook!" 
1249 
1250 Griphook was yet another goblin. Once Hagrid had crammed all the dog biscuits back inside his pockets, he and Harry followed Griphook toward one of the doors leading off the hall. 
1251 
1252 "What's the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen?" Harry asked. 
1253 
1254 "Can't tell yeh that," said Hagrid mysteriously. "Very secret. Hogwarts business. Dumbledore's trusted me. More'n my job's worth ter tell yeh that." 
1255 
1256 Griphook held the door open for them. Harry, who had expected more marble, was surprised. They were in a narrow stone passageway lit with flaming torches. It sloped steeply downward and there were little railway tracks on the floor. Griphook whistled and a small cart came hurtling up the tracks toward them. They climbed in -- Hagrid with some difficulty -- and were off. 
1257 
1258 At first they just hurtled through a maze of twisting passages. Harry tried to remember, left, right, right, left, middle fork, right, left, but it was impossible. The rattling cart seemed to know its own way, because Griphook wasn't steering. 
1259 
1260 Harry's eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them, but he kept them wide open. Once, he thought he saw a burst of fire at the end of a passage and twisted around to see if it was a dragon, but too late - - they plunged even deeper, passing an underground lake where huge stalactites and stalagmites grew from the ceiling and floor. 
1261 
1262 I never know," Harry called to Hagrid over the noise of the cart, "what's the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite?" 
1263 
1264 "Stalagmite's got an 'm' in it," said Hagrid. "An' don' ask me questions just now, I think I'm gonna be sick." 
1265 
1266 He did look very green, and when the cart stopped at last beside a small door in the passage wall, Hagrid got out and had to lean against the wall to stop his knees from trembling. 
1267 
1268 Griphook unlocked the door. A lot of green smoke came billowing out, and as it cleared, Harry gasped. Inside were mounds of gold coins. Columns of silver. Heaps of little bronze Knuts. 
1269 
1270 "All yours," smiled Hagrid. 
1271 
1272 All Harry's -- it was incredible. The Dursleys couldn't have known about this or they'd have had it from him faster than blinking. How often had they complained how much Harry cost them to keep? And all the time there had been a small fortune belonging to him, buried deep under London. 
1273 
1274 Hagrid helped Harry pile some of it into a bag. 
1275 
1276 "The gold ones are Galleons," he explained. "Seventeen silver Sickles to a Galleon and twenty-nine Knuts to a Sickle, it's easy enough. Right, that should be enough fer a couple o' terms, we'll keep the rest safe for yeh." He turned to Griphook. "Vault seven hundred and thirteen now, please, and can we go more slowly?" 
1277 
1278 "One speed only," said Griphook. 
1279 
1280 They were going even deeper now and gathering speed. The air became colder and colder as they hurtled round tight corners. They went rattling over an underground ravine, and Harry leaned over the side to try to see what was down at the dark bottom, but Hagrid groaned and pulled him back by the scruff of his neck. 
1281 
1282 Vault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole. 
1283 
1284 "Stand back," said Griphook importantly. He stroked the door gently with one of his long fingers and it simply melted away. 
1285 
1286 "If anyone but a Gringotts goblin tried that, they'd be sucked through the door and trapped in there," said Griphook. 
1287 
1288 "How often do you check to see if anyone's inside?" Harry asked. 
1289 
1290 "About once every ten years," said Griphook with a rather nasty grin. 
1291 
1292 Something really extraordinary had to be inside this top security vault, Harry was sure, and he leaned forward eagerly, expecting to see fabulous jewels at the very least -- but at first he thought it was empty. Then he noticed a grubby little package wrapped up in brown paper lying on the floor. Hagrid picked it up and tucked it deep inside his coat. Harry longed to know what it was, but knew better than to ask. 
1293 
1294 "Come on, back in this infernal cart, and don't talk to me on the way back, it's best if I keep me mouth shut," said Hagrid. 
1295 
1296 One wild cart ride later they stood blinking in the sunlight outside Gringotts. Harry didn't know where to run first now that he had a bag full of money. He didn't have to know how many Galleons there were to a pound to know that he was holding more money than he'd had in his whole life -- more money than even Dudley had ever had. 
1297 
1298 "Might as well get yer uniform," said Hagrid, nodding toward Madam Malkin's Robes for All Occasions. "Listen, Harry, would yeh mind if I slipped off fer a pick-me-up in the Leaky Cauldron? I hate them Gringotts carts." He did still look a bit sick, so Harry entered Madam Malkin's shop alone, feeling nervous. 
1299 
1300 Madam Malkin was a squat, smiling witch dressed all in mauve. 
1301 
1302 "Hogwarts, clear?" she said, when Harry started to speak. "Got the lot here -- another young man being fitted up just now, in fact. � 
1303 
1304 In the back of the shop, a boy with a pale, pointed face was standing on a footstool while a second witch pinned up his long black robes. Madam Malkin stood Harry on a stool next to him) slipped a long robe over his head, and began to pin it to the right length. 
1305 
1306 "Hello," said the boy, "Hogwarts, too?" 
1307 
1308 "Yes," said Harry. 
1309 
1310 "My father's next door buying my books and mother's up the street looking at wands," said the boy. He had a bored, drawling voice. "Then I'm going to drag them off to took at racing brooms. I don't see why first years can't have their own. I think I'll bully father into getting me one and I'll smuggle it in somehow." 
1311 
1312 Harry was strongly reminded of Dudley. 
1313 
1314 "Have you got your own broom?" the boy went on. 
1315 
1316 "No," said Harry. 
1317 
1318 "Play Quidditch at all?" 
1319 
1320 "No," Harry said again, wondering what on earth Quidditch could be. 
1321 
1322 "I do -- Father says it's a crime if I'm not picked to play for my house, and I must say, I agree. Know what house you'll be in yet?" 
1323 
1324 "No," said Harry, feeling more stupid by the minute. 
1325 
1326 "Well, no one really knows until they get there, do they, but I know I'll be in Slytherin, all our family have been -- imagine being in Hufflepuff, I think I'd leave, wouldn't you?" "Mmm," said Harry, wishing he could say something a bit more interesting. 
1327 
1328 "I say, look at that man!" said the boy suddenly, nodding toward the front window. Hagrid was standing there, grinning at Harry and pointing at two large ice creams to show he couldn't come in. 
1329 
1330 "That's Hagrid," said Harry, pleased to know something the boy didn't. 
1331 
1332 "He works at Hogwarts." 
1333 
1334 "Oh," said the boy, "I've heard of him. He's a sort of servant, isn't he?" 
1335 
1336 "He's the gamekeeper," said Harry. He was liking the boy less and less every second. 
1337 
1338 "Yes, exactly. I heard he's a sort of savage -- lives in a hut on the school grounds and every now and then he gets drunk, tries to do magic, and ends up setting fire to his bed." 
1339 
1340 "I think he's brilliant," said Harry coldly. 
1341 
1342 "Do you?" said the boy, with a slight sneer. "Why is he with you? Where are your parents?" 
1343 
1344 "They're dead," said Harry shortly. He didn't feel much like going into the matter with this boy. 
1345 
1346 "Oh, sorry," said the other,. not sounding sorry at all. "But they were our kind, weren't they?" 
1347 
1348 "They were a witch and wizard, if that's what you mean." 
1349 
1350 "I really don't think they should let the other sort in, do you? They're just not the same, they've never been brought up to know our ways. Some of them have never even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter, imagine. I think they should keep it in the old wizarding families. 
1351 
1352 What's your surname, anyway?" 
1353 
1354 But before Harry could answer, Madam Malkin said, "That's you done, my dear," and Harry, not sorry for an excuse to stop talking to the boy, hopped down from the footstool. 
1355 
1356 "Well, I'll see you at Hogwarts, I suppose," said the drawling boy. 
1357 
1358 Harry was rather quiet as he ate the ice cream Hagrid had bought him (chocolate and raspberry with chopped nuts). 
1359 
1360 "What's up?" said Hagrid. 
1361 
1362 "Nothing," Harry lied. They stopped to buy parchment and quills. Harry cheered up a bit when he found a bottle of ink that changed color as you wrote. When they had left the shop, he said, "Hagrid, what's Quidditch?" 
1363 
1364 "Blimey, Harry, I keep forgettin' how little yeh know -- not knowin' about Quidditch!" 
1365 
1366 "Don't make me feel worse," said Harry. He told Hagrid about the pate boy in Madam Malkin's. 
1367 
1368 "--and he said people from Muggle families shouldn't even be allowed in." 
1369 
1370 "Yer not from a Muggle family. If he'd known who yeh were -- he's grown up knowin' yer name if his parents are wizardin' folk. You saw what everyone in the Leaky Cauldron was like when they saw yeh. Anyway, what does he know about it, some o' the best I ever saw were the only ones with magic in 'em in a long line 0' Muggles -- look at yer mum! Look what she had fer a sister!" 
1371 
1372 "So what is Quidditch?" 
1373 
1374 "It's our sport. Wizard sport. It's like -- like soccer in the Muggle world -- everyone follows Quidditch -- played up in the air on broomsticks and there's four balls -- sorta hard ter explain the rules." 
1375 
1376 "And what are Slytherin and Hufflepuff?" 
1377 
1378 "School houses. There's four. Everyone says Hufflepuff are a lot o' duffers, but --" 
1379 
1380 "I bet I'm in Hufflepuff" said Harry gloomily. 
1381 
1382 "Better Hufflepuff than Slytherin," said Hagrid darkly. "There's not a single witch or wizard who went bad who wasn't in Slytherin. 
1383 
1384 You-Know-Who was one." 
1385 
1386 "Vol-, sorry - You-Know-Who was at Hogwarts?" 
1387 
1388 "Years an' years ago," said Hagrid. 
1389 
1390 They bought Harry's school books in a shop called Flourish and Blotts where the shelves were stacked to the ceiling with books as large as paving stones bound in leather; books the size of postage stamps in covers of silk; books full of peculiar symbols and a few books with nothing in them at all. Even Dudley, who never read anything, would have been wild to get his hands on some of these. Hagrid almost had to drag Harry away from Curses and Countercurses (Bewitch Your Friends and Befuddle Your Enemies with the Latest Revenges: Hair Loss, Jelly-Legs, Tongue- Tying and Much, Much More) by Professor Vindictus Viridian. 
1391 
1392 "I was trying to find out how to curse Dudley." 
1393 
1394 "I'm not sayin' that's not a good idea, but yer not ter use magic in the Muggle world except in very special circumstances," said Hagrid. "An' anyway, yeh couldn' work any of them curses yet, yeh'll need a lot more study before yeh get ter that level." 
1395 
1396 Hagrid wouldn't let Harry buy a solid gold cauldron, either ("It says pewter on yer list"), but they got a nice set of scales for weighing potion ingredients and a collapsible brass telescope. Then they visited the Apothecary, which was fascinating enough to make up for its horrible smell, a mixture of bad eggs and rotted cabbages. Barrels of slimy stuff stood on the floor; jars of herbs, dried roots, and bright powders lined the walls; bundles of feathers, strings of fangs, and snarled claws hung from the ceiling. While Hagrid asked the man behind the counter for a supply of some basic potion ingredients for Harry, Harry himself examined silver unicorn horns at twenty-one Galleons each and minuscule, glittery-black beetle eyes (five Knuts a scoop). 
1397 
1398 Outside the Apothecary, Hagrid checked Harry's list again. 
1399 
1400 "Just yer wand left - A yeah, an' I still haven't got yeh a birthday present." 
1401 
1402 Harry felt himself go red. 
1403 
1404 "You don't have to --" 
1405 
1406 "I know I don't have to. Tell yeh what, I'll get yer animal. Not a toad, toads went outta fashion years ago, yeh'd be laughed at - an' I don' like cats, they make me sneeze. I'll get yer an owl. All the kids want owls, they're dead useful, carry yer mail an' everythin'." 
1407 
1408 Twenty minutes later, they left Eeylops Owl Emporium, which had been dark and full of rustling and flickering, jewel-bright eyes. Harry now carried a large cage that held a beautiful snowy owl, fast asleep with her head under her wing. He couldn't stop stammering his thanks, sounding just like Professor Quirrell. 
1409 
1410 "Don' mention it," said Hagrid gruffly. "Don' expect you've had a lotta presents from them Dursleys. Just Ollivanders left now - only place fer wands, Ollivanders, and yeh gotta have the best wand." 
1411 
1412 A magic wand... this was what Harry had been really looking forward to. 
1413 
1414 The last shop was narrow and shabby. Peeling gold letters over the door read Ollivanders: Makers of Fine Wands since 382 B.C. A single wand lay on a faded purple cushion in the dusty window. 
1415 
1416 A tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the shop as they stepped inside. It was a tiny place, empty except for a single, spindly chair that Hagrid sat on to wait. Harry felt strangely as though he had entered a very strict library; he swallowed a lot of new questions that had just occurred to him and looked instead at the thousands of narrow boxes piled neatly right up to the ceiling. For some reason, the back of his neck prickled. The very dust and silence in here seemed to tingle with some secret magic. 
1417 
1418 "Good afternoon," said a soft voice. Harry jumped. Hagrid must have jumped, too, because there was a loud crunching noise and he got quickly off the spindly chair. 
1419 
1420 An old man was standing before them, his wide, pale eyes shining like moons through the gloom of the shop. 
1421 
1422 "Hello," said Harry awkwardly. 
1423 
1424 "Ah yes," said the man. "Yes, yes. I thought I'd be seeing you soon. 
1425 
1426 Harry Potter." It wasn't a question. "You have your mother's eyes. It seems only yesterday she was in here herself, buying her first wand. Ten and a quarter inches long, swishy, made of willow. Nice wand for charm work." 
1427 
1428 Mr. Ollivander moved closer to Harry. Harry wished he would blink. Those silvery eyes were a bit creepy. 
1429 
1430 "Your father, on the other hand, favored a mahogany wand. Eleven inches. 
1431 
1432 Pliable. A little more power and excellent for transfiguration. Well, I say your father favored it -- it's really the wand that chooses the wizard, of course." 
1433 
1434 Mr. Ollivander had come so close that he and Harry were almost nose to nose. Harry could see himself reflected in those misty eyes. 
1435 
1436 "And that's where..." 
1437 
1438 Mr. Ollivander touched the lightning scar on Harry's forehead with a long, white finger. 
1439 
1440 "I'm sorry to say I sold the wand that did it," he said softly. 
1441 
1442 "Thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Powerful wand, very powerful, and in the wrong hands... well, if I'd known what that wand was going out into the world to do...." 
1443 
1444 He shook his head and then, to Harry's relief, spotted Hagrid. 
1445 
1446 "Rubeus! Rubeus Hagrid! How nice to see you again.... Oak, sixteen inches, rather bendy, wasn't it?" 
1447 
1448 "It was, sir, yes," said Hagrid. 
1449 
1450 "Good wand, that one. But I suppose they snapped it in half when you got expelled?" said Mr. Ollivander, suddenly stern. 
1451 
1452 "Er -- yes, they did, yes," said Hagrid, shuffling his feet. "I've still got the pieces, though," he added brightly. 
1453 
1454 "But you don't use them?" said Mr. Ollivander sharply. 
1455 
1456 "Oh, no, sit," said Hagrid quickly. Harry noticed he gripped his pink umbrella very tightly as he spoke. 
1457 
1458 "Hmmm," said Mr. Ollivander, giving Hagrid a piercing look. "Well, now -- Mr. Potter. Let me see." He pulled a long tape measure with silver markings out of his pocket. "Which is your wand arm?" 
1459 
1460 "Er -- well, I'm right-handed," said Harry. 
1461 
1462 "Hold out your arm. That's it." He measured Harry from shoulder to finger, then wrist to elbow, shoulder to floor, knee to armpit and round his head. As he measured, he said, "Every Ollivander wand has a core of a powerful magical substance, Mr. Potter. We use unicorn hairs, phoenix tail feathers, and the heartstrings of dragons. No two Ollivander wands are the same, just as no two unicorns, dragons, or phoenixes are quite the same. And of course, you will never get such good results with another wizard's wand." 
1463 
1464 Harry suddenly realized that the tape measure, which was measuring between his nostrils, was doing this on its own. Mr. Ollivander was flitting around the shelves, taking down boxes. 
1465 
1466 "That will do," he said, and the tape measure crumpled into a heap on the floor. "Right then, Mr. Potter. Try this one. Beechwood and dragon heartstring. Nine inches. Nice and flexible. just take it and give it a wave." 
1467 
1468 Harry took the wand and (feeling foolish) waved it around a bit, but Mr. Ollivander snatched it out of his hand almost at once. 
1469 
1470 "Maple and phoenix feather. Seven inches. Quite whippy. Try --" 
1471 
1472 Harry tried -- but he had hardly raised the wand when it, too, was snatched back by Mr. Ollivander. 
1473 
1474 "No, no -here, ebony and unicorn hair, eight and a half inches, springy. 
1475 
1476 Go on, go on, try it out." 
1477 
1478 Harry tried. And tried. He had no idea what Mr. Ollivander was waiting for. The pile of tried wands was mounting higher and higher on the spindly chair, but the more wands Mr. Ollivander pulled from the shelves, the happier he seemed to become. 
1479 
1480 "Tricky customer, eh? Not to worry, we'll find the perfect match here somewhere -- I wonder, now - - yes, why not -- unusual combination -- holly and phoenix feather, eleven inches, nice and supple." 
1481 
1482 Harry took the wand. He felt a sudden warmth in his fingers. He raised the wand above his head, brought it swishing down through the dusty air and a stream of red and gold sparks shot from the end like a firework, throwing dancing spots of light on to the walls. Hagrid whooped and clapped and Mr. Ollivander cried, "Oh, bravo! Yes, indeed, oh, very good. Well, well, well... how curious... how very curious... � 
1483 
1484 He put Harry's wand back into its box and wrapped it in brown paper, still muttering, "Curious... curious.. 
1485 
1486 "Sorry," said Harry, "but what's curious?" 
1487 
1488 Mr. Ollivander fixed Harry with his pale stare. 
1489 
1490 "I remember every wand I've ever sold, Mr. Potter. Every single wand. It so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is in your wand, gave another feather -- just one other. It is very curious indeed that you should be destined for this wand when its brother why, its brother gave you that scar." 
1491 
1492 Harry swallowed. 
1493 
1494 "Yes, thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Curious indeed how these things happen. The wand chooses the wizard, remember.... I think we must expect great things from you, Mr. Potter.... After all, He- Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things -- terrible, yes, but great." 
1495 
1496 Harry shivered. He wasn't sure he liked Mr. Ollivander too much. He paid seven gold Galleons for his wand, and Mr. Ollivander bowed them from his shop. 
1497 
1498 The late afternoon sun hung low in the sky as Harry and Hagrid made their way back down Diagon Alley, back through the wall, back through the Leaky Cauldron, now empty. Harry didn't speak at all as they walked down the road; he didn't even notice how much people were gawking at them on the Underground, laden as they were with all their funny-shaped packages, with the snowy owl asleep in its cage on Harry's lap. Up another escalator, out into Paddington station; Harry only realized where they were when Hagrid tapped him on the shoulder. 
1499 
1500 "Got time fer a bite to eat before yer train leaves," he said. 
1501 
1502 He bought Harry a hamburger and they sat down on plastic seats to eat them. Harry kept looking around. Everything looked so strange, somehow. 
1503 
1504 "You all right, Harry? Yer very quiet," said Hagrid. 
1505 
1506 Harry wasn't sure he could explain. He'd just had the best birthday of his life -- and yet -- he chewed his hamburger, trying to find the words. 
1507 
1508 "Everyone thinks I'm special," he said at last. "All those people in the Leaky Cauldron, Professor Quirrell, Mr. Ollivander... but I don't know anything about magic at all. How can they expect great things? I'm famous and I can't even remember what I'm famous for. I don't know what happened when Vol-, sorry -- I mean, the night my parents died." 
1509 
1510 Hagrid leaned across the table. Behind the wild beard and eyebrows he wore a very kind smile. 
1511 
1512 "Don' you worry, Harry. You'll learn fast enough. Everyone starts at the beginning at Hogwarts, you'll be just fine. just be yerself. I know it's hard. Yeh've been singled out, an' that's always hard. But yeh'll have a great time at Hogwarts -- I did -- still do, 'smatter of fact." 
1513 
1514 Hagrid helped Harry on to the train that would take him back to the Dursleys, then handed him an envelope. 
1515 
1516 "Yer ticket fer Hogwarts, " he said. "First o' September -- King's Cross -- it's all on yer ticket. Any problems with the Dursleys, send me a letter with yer owl, she'll know where to find me.... See yeh soon, Harry." 
1517 
1518 The train pulled out of the station. Harry wanted to watch Hagrid until he was out of sight; he rose in his seat and pressed his nose against the window, but he blinked and Hagrid had gone. 
1519 
1520 CHAPTER SIX 
1521 
1522 THE JOURNEY FROM PLATFORM NINE AND THREE-QUARTERS 
1523 
1524 Harry's last month with the Dursleys wasn't fun. True, Dudley was now so scared of Harry he wouldn't stay in the same room, while Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon didn't shut Harry in his cupboard, force him to do anything, or shout at him -- in fact, they didn't speak to him at all. 
1525 
1526 Half terrified, half furious, they acted as though any chair with Harry in it were empty. Although this was an improvement in many ways, it did become a bit depressing after a while. 
1527 
1528 Harry kept to his room, with his new owl for company. He had decided to call her Hedwig, a name he had found in A History of Magic. His school books were very interesting. He lay on his bed reading late into the night, Hedwig swooping in and out of the open window as she pleased. It was lucky that Aunt Petunia didn't come in to vacuum anymore, because Hedwig kept bringing back dead mice. Every night before he went to sleep, Harry ticked off another day on the piece of paper he had pinned to the wall, counting down to September the first. 
1529 
1530 On the last day of August he thought he'd better speak to his aunt and uncle about getting to King's Cross station the next day, so he went down to the living room where they were watching a quiz show on television. He cleared his throat to let them know he was there, and Dudley screamed and ran from the room. 
1531 
1532 "Er -- Uncle Vernon?" 
1533 
1534 Uncle Vernon grunted to show he was listening. 
1535 
1536 "Er -- I need to be at King's Cross tomorrow to -- to go to Hogwarts." 
1537 
1538 Uncle Vernon grunted again. 
1539 
1540 "Would it be all right if you gave me a lift?" 
1541 
1542 Grunt. Harry supposed that meant yes. 
1543 
1544 "Thank you." 
1545 
1546 He was about to go back upstairs when Uncle Vernon actually spoke. 
1547 
1548 "Funny way to get to a wizards' school, the train. Magic carpets all got punctures, have they?" 
1549 
1550 Harry didn't say anything. 
1551 
1552 "Where is this school, anyway?" 
1553 
1554 "I don't know," said Harry, realizing this for the first time. He pulled the ticket Hagrid had given him out of his pocket. 
1555 
1556 "I just take the train from platform nine and three-quarters at eleven o'clock," he read. 
1557 
1558 His aunt and uncle stared. 
1559 
1560 "Platform what?" 
1561 
1562 "Nine and three-quarters." 
1563 
1564 "Don't talk rubbish," said Uncle Vernon. "There is no platform nine and three-quarters." 
1565 
1566 "It's on my ticket." 
1567 
1568 "Barking," said Uncle Vernon, "howling mad, the lot of them. You'll see. 
1569 
1570 You just wait. All right, we'll take you to King's Cross. We're going up to London tomorrow anyway, or I wouldn't bother." 
1571 
1572 "Why are you going to London?" Harry asked, trying to keep things friendly. 
1573 
1574 "Taking Dudley to the hospital," growled Uncle Vernon. "Got to have that ruddy tail removed before he goes to Smeltings." 
1575 
1576 Harry woke at five o'clock the next morning and was too excited and nervous to go back to sleep. He got up and pulled on his jeans because he didn't want to walk into the station in his wizard's robes -- he'd change on the train. He checked his Hogwarts list yet again to make sure he had everything he needed, saw that Hedwig was shut safely in her cage, and then paced the room, waiting for the Dursleys to get up. Two hours later, Harry's huge, heavy trunk had been loaded into the Dursleys' car, Aunt Petunia had talked Dudley into sitting next to Harry, and they had set off. 
1577 
1578 They reached King's Cross at half past ten. Uncle Vernon dumped Harry's trunk onto a cart and wheeled it into the station for him. Harry thought this was strangely kind until Uncle Vernon stopped dead, facing the platforms with a nasty grin on his face. 
1579 
1580 "Well, there you are, boy. Platform nine -- platform ten. Your platform should be somewhere in the middle, but they don't seem to have built it yet, do they?" 
1581 
1582 He was quite right, of course. There was a big plastic number nine over one platform and a big plastic number ten over the one next to it, and in the middle, nothing at all. 
1583 
1584 "Have a good term," said Uncle Vernon with an even nastier smile. He left without another word. Harry turned and saw the Dursleys drive away. 
1585 
1586 All three of them were laughing. Harry's mouth went rather dry. What on earth was he going to do? He was starting to attract a lot of funny looks, because of Hedwig. He'd have to ask someone. 
1587 
1588 He stopped a passing guard, but didn't dare mention platform nine and three-quarters. The guard had never heard of Hogwarts and when Harry couldn't even tell him what part of the country it was in, he started to get annoyed, as though Harry was being stupid on purpose. Getting desperate, Harry asked for the train that left at eleven o'clock, but the guard said there wasn't one. In the end the guard strode away, muttering about time wasters. Harry was now trying hard not to panic. 
1589 
1590 According to the large clock over the arrivals board, he had ten minutes left to get on the train to Hogwarts and he had no idea how to do it; he was stranded in the middle of a station with a trunk he could hardly lift, a pocket full of wizard money, and a large owl. 
1591 
1592 Hagrid must have forgotten to tell him something you had to do, like tapping the third brick on the left to get into Diagon Alley. He wondered if he should get out his wand and start tapping the ticket inspector's stand between platforms nine and ten. 
1593 
1594 At that moment a group of people passed just behind him and he caught a few words of what they were saying. 
1595 
1596 "-- packed with Muggles, of course --" 
1597 
1598 Harry swung round. The speaker was a plump woman who was talking to four boys, all with flaming red hair. Each of them was pushing a trunk like Harry's in front of him -- and they had an owl. 
1599 
1600 Heart hammering, Harry pushed his cart after them. They stopped and so did he, just near enough to hear what they were saying. 
1601 
1602 "Now, what's the platform number?" said the boys' mother. 
1603 
1604 "Nine and three-quarters!" piped a small girl, also red-headed, who was holding her hand, "Mom, can't I go... � 
1605 
1606 "You're not old enough, Ginny, now be quiet. All right, Percy, you go first." 
1607 
1608 What looked like the oldest boy marched toward platforms nine and ten. 
1609 
1610 Harry watched, careful not to blink in case he missed it -- but just as the boy reached the dividing barrier between the two platforms, a large crowd of tourists came swarming in front of him and by the time the last backpack had cleared away, the boy had vanished. 
1611 
1612 "Fred, you next," the plump woman said. 
1613 
1614 "I'm not Fred, I'm George," said the boy. "Honestly, woman, you call yourself our mother? CarA you tell I'm George?" 
1615 
1616 "Sorry, George, dear." 
1617 
1618 "Only joking, I am Fred," said the boy, and off he went. His twin called after him to hurry up, and he must have done so, because a second later, he had gone -- but how had he done it? Now the third brother was walking briskly toward the barrier he was almost there -- and then, quite suddenly, he wasn't anywhere. 
1619 
1620 There was nothing else for it. 
1621 
1622 "Excuse me," Harry said to the plump woman. 
1623 
1624 "Hello, dear," she said. "First time at Hogwarts? Ron's new, too." 
1625 
1626 She pointed at the last and youngest of her sons. He was tall, thin, and gangling, with freckles, big hands and feet, and a long nose. 
1627 
1628 "Yes," said Harry. "The thing is -- the thing is, I don't know how to --" 
1629 
1630 "How to get onto the platform?" she said kindly, and Harry nodded. 
1631 
1632 "Not to worry," she said. "All you have to do is walk straight at the barrier between platforms nine and ten. Don't stop and don't be scared you'll crash into it, that's very important. Best do it at a bit of a run if you're nervous. Go on, go now before Ron." 
1633 
1634 "Er -- okay," said Harry. 
1635 
1636 He pushed his trolley around and stared at the barrier. It looked very solid. 
1637 
1638 He started to walk toward it. People jostled him on their way to platforms nine and ten. Harry walked more quickly. He was going to smash right into that barrier and then he'd be in trouble -- leaning forward on his cart, he broke into a heavy run -- the barrier was coming nearer and nearer -- he wouldn't be able to stop -- the cart was out of control -- he was a foot away -- he closed his eyes ready for the crash -- It didn't come... he kept on running... he opened his eyes. A scarlet steam engine was waiting next to a platform packed with people. A sign overhead said Hogwarts Express, eleven O'clock. Harry looked behind him and saw a wrought-iron archway where the barrier had been, with the words Platform Nine and Three-Quarters on it, He had done it. 
1639 
1640 Smoke from the engine drifted over the heads of the chattering crowd, while cats of every color wound here and there between their legs. Owls hooted to one another in a disgruntled sort of way over the babble and the scraping of heavy trunks. 
1641 
1642 The first few carriages were already packed with students, some hanging out of the window to talk to their families, some fighting over seats. 
1643 
1644 Harry pushed his cart off down the platform in search of an empty seat. 
1645 
1646 He passed a round-faced boy who was saying, "Gran, I've lost my toad again." 
1647 
1648 "Oh, Neville," he heard the old woman sigh. 
1649 
1650 A boy with dreadlocks was surrounded by a small crowd. 
1651 
1652 "Give us a look, Lee, go on." 
1653 
1654 The boy lifted the lid of a box in his arms, and the people around him shrieked and yelled as something inside poked out a long, hairy leg. 
1655 
1656 Harry pressed on through the crowd until he found an empty compartment near the end of the train. He put Hedwig inside first and then started to shove and heave his trunk toward the train door. He tried to lift it up the steps but could hardly raise one end and twice he dropped it painfully on his foot. 
1657 
1658 "Want a hand?" It was one of the red-haired twins he'd followed through the barrier. 
1659 
1660 "Yes, please," Harry panted. 
1661 
1662 "Oy, Fred! C'mere and help!" 
1663 
1664 With the twins' help, Harry's trunk was at last tucked away in a corner of the compartment. 
1665 
1666 "Thanks," said Harry, pushing his sweaty hair out of his eyes. 
1667 
1668 "What's that?" said one of the twins suddenly, pointing at Harry's lightning scar. 
1669 
1670 "Blimey," said the other twin. "Are you "He is," said the first twin. "Aren't you?" he added to Harry. 
1671 
1672 "What?" said Harry. 
1673 
1674 "Harry Potter, "chorused the twins. 
1675 
1676 "Oh, him," said Harry. "I mean, yes, I am." 
1677 
1678 The two boys gawked at him, and Harry felt himself turning red. Then, to his relief, a voice came floating in through the train's open door. 
1679 
1680 "Fred? George? Are you there?" 
1681 
1682 "Coming, Mom." 
1683 
1684 With a last look at Harry, the twins hopped off the train. 
1685 
1686 Harry sat down next to the window where, half hidden, he could watch the red-haired family on the platform and hear what they were saying. Their mother had just taken out her handkerchief. 
1687 
1688 "Ron, you've got something on your nose." 
1689 
1690 The youngest boy tried to jerk out of the way, but she grabbed him and began rubbing the end of his nose. 
1691 
1692 "Mom -- geroff" He wriggled free. 
1693 
1694 "Aaah, has ickle Ronnie got somefink on his nosie?" said one of the twins. 
1695 
1696 "Shut up," said Ron. 
1697 
1698 "Where's Percy?" said their mother. 
1699 
1700 "He's coming now." 
1701 
1702 The oldest boy came striding into sight. He had already changed into his billowing black Hogwarts robes, and Harry noticed a shiny silver badge on his chest with the letter P on it. 
1703 
1704 "Can't stay long, Mother," he said. "I'm up front, the prefects have got two compartments to themselves --" 
1705 
1706 "Oh, are you a prefect, Percy?" said one of the twins, with an air of great surprise. "You should have said something, we had no idea." 
1707 
1708 "Hang on, I think I remember him saying something about it," said the other twin. "Once --" 
1709 
1710 "Or twice --" 
1711 
1712 "A minute --" 
1713 
1714 "All summer --" 
1715 
1716 "Oh, shut up," said Percy the Prefect. 
1717 
1718 "How come Percy gets new robes, anyway?" said one of the twins. 
1719 
1720 "Because he's a prefect," said their mother fondly. "All right, dear, well, have a good term -- send me an owl when you get there." 
1721 
1722 She kissed Percy on the cheek and he left. Then she turned to the twins. 
1723 
1724 "Now, you two -- this year, you behave yourselves. If I get one more owl telling me you've -- you've blown up a toilet or --" 
1725 
1726 "Blown up a toilet? We've never blown up a toilet." 
1727 
1728 "Great idea though, thanks, Mom." 
1729 
1730 "It's not funny. And look after Ron." 
1731 
1732 "Don't worry, ickle Ronniekins is safe with us." 
1733 
1734 "Shut up," said Ron again. He was almost as tall as the twins already and his nose was still pink where his mother had rubbed it. 
1735 
1736 "Hey, Mom, guess what? Guess who we just met on the train?" 
1737 
1738 Harry leaned back quickly so they couldn't see him looking. 
1739 
1740 "You know that black-haired boy who was near us in the station? Know who he is?" 
1741 
1742 "Who?" 
1743 
1744 "Harry Potter!" 
1745 
1746 Harry heard the little girl's voice. 
1747 
1748 "Oh, Mom, can I go on the train and see him, Mom, eh please...." 
1749 
1750 "You've already seen him, Ginny, and the poor boy isn't something you goggle at in a zoo. Is he really, Fred? How do you know?" 
1751 
1752 "Asked him. Saw his scar. It's really there - like lightning." 
1753 
1754 "Poor dear - no wonder he was alone, I wondered. He was ever so polite when he asked how to get onto the platform." 
1755 
1756 "Never mind that, do you think he remembers what You-Know-Who looks like?" 
1757 
1758 Their mother suddenly became very stern. 
1759 
1760 "I forbid you to ask him, Fred. No, don't you dare. As though he needs reminding of that on his first day at school." 
1761 
1762 "All right, keep your hair on." 
1763 
1764 A whistle sounded. 
1765 
1766 "Hurry up!" their mother said, and the three boys clambered onto the train. They leaned out of the window for her to kiss them good-bye, and their younger sister began to cry. 
1767 
1768 "Don't, Ginny, we'll send you loads of owls." 
1769 
1770 "We'll send you a Hogwarts toilet seat." 
1771 
1772 "George!" 
1773 
1774 "Only joking, Mom." 
1775 
1776 The train began to move. Harry saw the boys' mother waving and their sister, half laughing, half crying, running to keep up with the train until it gathered too much speed, then she fell back and waved. 
1777 
1778 Harry watched the girl and her mother disappear as the train rounded the corner. Houses flashed past the window. Harry felt a great leap of excitement. He didn't know what he was going to but it had to be better than what he was leaving behind. 
1779 
1780 The door of the compartment slid open and the youngest redheaded boy came in. 
1781 
1782 "Anyone sitting there?" he asked, pointing at the seat opposite Harry. 
1783 
1784 "Everywhere else is full." 
1785 
1786 Harry shook his head and the boy sat down. He glanced at Harry and then looked quickly out of the window, pretending he hadn't looked. Harry saw he still had a black mark on his nose. 
1787 
1788 "Hey, Ron." 
1789 
1790 The twins were back. 
1791 
1792 "Listen, we're going down the middle of the train -- Lee Jordan's got a giant tarantula down there." 
1793 
1794 "Right," mumbled Ron. 
1795 
1796 "Harry," said the other twin, "did we introduce ourselves? Fred and George Weasley. And this is Ron, our brother. See you later, then. 
1797 
1798 "Bye," said Harry and Ron. The twins slid the compartment door shut behind them. 
1799 
1800 "Are you really Harry Potter?" Ron blurted out. 
1801 
1802 Harry nodded. 
1803 
1804 "Oh -well, I thought it might be one of Fred and George's jokes," said Ron. "And have you really got -- you know..." 
1805 
1806 He pointed at Harry's forehead. 
1807 
1808 Harry pulled back his bangs to show the lightning scar. Ron stared. 
1809 
1810 "So that's where You-Know-Who "Yes," said Harry, "but I can't remember it." 
1811 
1812 "Nothing?" said Ron eagerly. 
1813 
1814 "Well -- I remember a lot of green light, but nothing else." 
1815 
1816 "Wow," said Ron. He sat and stared at Harry for a few moments, then, as though he had suddenly realized what he was doing, he looked quickly out of the window again. 
1817 
1818 "Are all your family wizards?" asked Harry, who found Ron just as interesting as Ron found him. 
1819 
1820 "Er -- Yes, I think so," said Ron. "I think Mom's got a second cousin who's an accountant, but we never talk about him." 
1821 
1822 "So you must know loads of magic already." 
1823 
1824 The Weasleys were clearly one of those old wizarding families the pale boy in Diagon Alley had talked about. 
1825 
1826 "I heard you went to live with Muggles," said Ron. "What are they like?" 
1827 
1828 "Horrible -well, not all of them. My aunt and uncle and cousin are, though. Wish I'd had three wizard brothers." 
1829 
1830 "Five," said Ron. For some reason, he was looking gloomy. "I'm the sixth in our family to go to Hogwarts. You could say I've got a lot to live up to. Bill and Charlie have already left -- Bill was head boy and Charlie was captain of Quidditch. Now Percy's a prefect. Fred and George mess around a lot, but they still get really good marks and everyone thinks they're really funny. Everyone expects me to do as well as the others, but if I do, it's no big deal, because they did it first. You never get anything new, either, with five brothers. I've got Bill's old robes, Charlie's old wand, and Percy's old rat." 
1831 
1832 Ron reached inside his jacket and pulled out a fat gray rat, which was asleep. 
1833 
1834 "His name's Scabbers and he's useless, he hardly ever wakes up. Percy got an owl from my dad for being made a prefect, but they couldn't aff -- I mean, I got Scabbers instead." 
1835 
1836 Ron's ears went pink. He seemed to think he'd said too much, because he went back to staring out of the window. 
1837 
1838 Harry didn't think there was anything wrong with not being able to afford an owl. After all, he'd never had any money in his life until a month ago, and he told Ron so, all about having to wear Dudley's old clothes and never getting proper birthday presents. This seemed to cheer Ron up. 
1839 
1840 "... and until Hagrid told me, I didn't know anything about be ing a wizard or about my parents or Voldemort" 
1841 
1842 Ron gasped. 
1843 
1844 "What?" said Harry. 
1845 
1846 "You said You-Know-Who's name!" said Ron, sounding both shocked and impressed. "I'd have thought you, of all people --" 
1847 
1848 "I'm not trying to be brave or anything, saying the name," said Harry, I just never knew you shouldn't. See what I mean? I've got loads to learn.... I bet," he added, voicing for the first time something that had been worrying him a lot lately, "I bet I'm the worst in the class." 
1849 
1850 "You won't be. There's loads of people who come from Muggle families and they learn quick enough." 
1851 
1852 While they had been talking, the train had carried them out of London. 
1853 
1854 Now they were speeding past fields full of cows and sheep. They were quiet for a time, watching the fields and lanes flick past. 
1855 
1856 Around half past twelve there was a great clattering outside in the corridor and a smiling, dimpled woman slid back their door and said, "Anything off the cart, dears?" 
1857 
1858 Harry, who hadn't had any breakfast, leapt to his feet, but Ron's ears went pink again and he muttered that he'd brought sandwiches. Harry went out into the corridor. 
1859 
1860 He had never had any money for candy with the Dursleys, and now that he had pockets rattling with gold and silver he was ready to buy as many Mars Bars as he could carry -- but the woman didn't have Mars Bars. What she did have were Bettie Bott's Every Flavor Beans, Drooble's Best Blowing Gum, Chocolate Frogs. Pumpkin Pasties, Cauldron Cakes, Licorice Wands, and a number of other strange things Harry had never seen in his life. Not wanting to miss anything, he got some of everything and paid the woman eleven silver Sickles and seven bronze Knuts. 
1861 
1862 Ron stared as Harry brought it all back in to the compartment and tipped it onto an empty seat. 
1863 
1864 "Hungry, are you?" 
1865 
1866 "Starving," said Harry, taking a large bite out of a pumpkin pasty. 
1867 
1868 Ron had taken out a lumpy package and unwrapped it. There were four sandwiches inside. He pulled one of them apart and said, "She always forgets I don't like corned beef." 
1869 
1870 "Swap you for one of these," said Harry, holding up a pasty. "Go on --" 
1871 
1872 "You don't want this, it's all dry," said Ron. "She hasn't got much time," he added quickly, "you know, with five of us." 
1873 
1874 "Go on, have a pasty," said Harry, who had never had anything to share before or, indeed, anyone to share it with. It was a nice feeling, sitting there with Ron, eating their way through all Harry's pasties, cakes, and candies (the sandwiches lay forgotten). 
1875 
1876 "What are these?" Harry asked Ron, holding up a pack of Chocolate Frogs. 
1877 
1878 "They're not really frogs, are they?" He was starting to feel that nothing would surprise him. 
1879 
1880 "No," said Ron. "But see what the card is. I'm missing Agrippa." 
1881 
1882 "What?" 
1883 
1884 "Oh, of course, you wouldn't know -- Chocolate Frogs have cards, inside them, you know, to collect -- famous witches and wizards. I've got about five hundred, but I haven't got Agrippa or Ptolemy." 
1885 
1886 Harry unwrapped his Chocolate Frog and picked up the card. It showed a man's face. He wore half- moon glasses, had a long, crooked nose, and flowing silver hair, beard, and mustache. Underneath the picture was the name Albus Dumbledore. 
1887 
1888 "So this is Dumbledore!" said Harry. 
1889 
1890 "Don't tell me you'd never heard of Dumbledore!" said Ron. "Can I have a frog? I might get Agrippa -- thanks Harry turned over his card and read: ALBUS DUMBLEDORE CURRENTLY HEADMASTER OF HOGWARTS Considered by many the greatest wizard of modern times, Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon's blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel. Professor Dumbledore enjoys chamber music and tenpin bowling. 
1891 
1892 Harry turned the card back over and saw, to his astonishment, that Dumbledore's face had disappeared. 
1893 
1894 "He's gone!" 
1895 
1896 "Well, you can't expect him to hang around all day," said Ron. "He'll be back. No, I've got Morgana again and I've got about six of her... do you want it? You can start collecting." 
1897 
1898 Ron's eyes strayed to the pile of Chocolate Frogs waiting to be unwrapped. 
1899 
1900 "Help yourself," said Harry. "But in, you know, the Muggle world, people just stay put in photos." 
1901 
1902 "Do they? What, they don't move at all?" Ron sounded amazed. "weird!" 
1903 
1904 Harry stared as Dumbledore sidled back into the picture on his card and gave him a small smile. Ron was more interested in eating the frogs than looking at the Famous Witches and Wizards cards, but Harry couldn't keep his eyes off them. Soon he had not only Dumbledore and Morgana, but Hengist of Woodcroft, Alberic Grunnion, Circe, Paracelsus, and Merlin. 
1905 
1906 He finally tore his eyes away from the druidess Cliodna, who was scratching her nose, to open a bag of Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans. 
1907 
1908 "You want to be careful with those," Ron warned Harry. "When they say every flavor, they mean every flavor -- you know, you get all the ordinary ones like chocolate and peppermint and mar- malade, but then you can get spinach and liver and tripe. George reckons he had a boogerflavored one once." 
1909 
1910 Ron picked up a green bean, looked at it carefully, and bit into a corner. 
1911 
1912 "Bleaaargh -- see? Sprouts." 
1913 
1914 They had a good time eating the Every Flavor Beans. Harry got toast, coconut, baked bean, strawberry, curry, grass, coffee, sardine, and was even brave enough to nibble the end off a funny gray one Ron wouldn't touch, which turned out to be pepper. 
1915 
1916 The countryside now flying past the window was becoming wilder. The neat fields had gone. Now there were woods, twisting rivers, and dark green hills. 
1917 
1918 There was a knock on the door of their compartment and the round-faced boy Harry had passed on platform nine and threequarters came in. He looked tearful. 
1919 
1920 "Sorry," he said, "but have you seen a toad at all?" 
1921 
1922 When they shook their heads, he wailed, "I've lost him! He keeps getting away from me!" 
1923 
1924 "He'll turn up," said Harry. 
1925 
1926 "Yes," said the boy miserably. "Well, if you see him..." 
1927 
1928 He left. 
1929 
1930 "Don't know why he's so bothered," said Ron. "If I'd brought a toad I'd lose it as quick as I could. Mind you, I brought Scabbers, so I can't talk." 
1931 
1932 The rat was still snoozing on Ron's lap. 
1933 
1934 "He might have died and you wouldn't know the difference," said Ron in disgust. "I tried to turn him yellow yesterday to make him more interesting, but the spell didn't work. I'll show you, look..." 
1935 
1936 He rummaged around in his trunk and pulled out a very battered-looking wand. It was chipped in places and something white was glinting at the end. 
1937 
1938 "Unicorn hair's nearly poking out. Anyway He had just raised his 'wand when the compartment door slid open again. 
1939 
1940 The toadless boy was back, but this time he had a girl with him. She was already wearing her new Hogwarts robes. 
1941 
1942 "Has anyone seen a toad? Neville's lost one," she said. She had a bossy sort of voice, lots of bushy brown hair, and rather large front teeth. 
1943 
1944 "We've already told him we haven't seen it," said Ron, but the girl wasn't listening, she was looking at the wand in his hand. 
1945 
1946 "Oh, are you doing magic? Let's see it, then." 
1947 
1948 She sat down. Ron looked taken aback. 
1949 
1950 "Er -- all right." 
1951 
1952 He cleared his throat. 
1953 
1954 "Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow, Turn this stupid, fat rat yellow." 
1955 
1956 He waved his wand, but nothing happened. Scabbers stayed gray and fast asleep. 
1957 
1958 "Are you sure that's a real spell?" said the girl. "Well, it's not very good, is it? I've tried a few simple spells just for practice and it's all worked for me. Nobody in my family's magic at all, it was ever such a surprise when I got my letter, but I was ever so pleased, of course, I mean, it's the very best school of witchcraft there is, I've heard -- I've learned all our course books by heart, of course, I just hope it will be enough -- I'm Hermione Granger, by the way, who are you. 
1959 
1960 She said all this very fast. 
1961 
1962 Harry looked at Ron, and was relieved to see by his stunned face that he hadn't learned all the course books by heart either. 
1963 
1964 "I'm Ron Weasley," Ron muttered. 
1965 
1966 "Harry Potter," said Harry. 
1967 
1968 "Are you really?" said Hermione. "I know all about you, of course -- I got a few extra books. for background reading, and you're in Modern Magical History and The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts and Great Wizarding Events of the Twentieth Century. 
1969 
1970 "Am I?" said Harry, feeling dazed. 
1971 
1972 "Goodness, didn't you know, I'd have found out everything I could if it was me," said Hermione. "Do either of you know what house you'll be in? I've been asking around, and I hope I'm in Gryffindor, it sounds by far the best; I hear Dumbledore himself was in it, but I suppose Ravenclaw wouldn't be too bad.... Anyway, we'd better go and look for Neville's toad. You two had better change, you know, I expect we'll be there soon." 
1973 
1974 And she left, taking the toadless boy with her. 
1975 
1976 "Whatever house I'm in, I hope she's not in it," said Ron. He threw his wand back into his trunk. "Stupid spell -- George gave it to me, bet he knew it was a dud." 
1977 
1978 "What house are your brothers in?" asked Harry. 
1979 
1980 "Gryffindor," said Ron. Gloom seemed to be settling on him again. "Mom and Dad were in it, too. I don't know what they'll say if I'm not. I don't suppose Ravenclaw would be too bad, but imagine if they put me in Slytherin." 
1981 
1982 "That's the house Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who was in?" 
1983 
1984 "Yeah," said Ron. He flopped back into his seat, looking depressed. 
1985 
1986 "You know, I think the ends of Scabbers' whiskers are a bit lighter," 
1987 
1988 said Harry, trying to take Ron's mind off houses. "So what do your oldest brothers do now that they've left, anyway?" 
1989 
1990 Harry was wondering what a wizard did once he'd finished school. 
1991 
1992 "Charlie's in Romania studying dragons, and Bill's in Africa doing something for Gringotts," said Ron. "Did you hear about Gringotts? It's been all over the Daily Prophet, but I don't suppose you get that with the Muggles -- someone tried to rob a high security vault." 
1993 
1994 Harry stared. 
1995 
1996 "Really? What happened to them?" 
1997 
1998 "Nothing, that's why it's such big news. They haven't been caught. My dad says it must've been a powerful Dark wizard to get round Gringotts, but they don't think they took anything, that's what's odd. 'Course, everyone gets scared when something like this happens in case You-Know-Who's behind it." 
1999 
2000 Harry turned this news over in his mind. He was starting to get a prickle of fear every time You- Know-Who was mentioned. He supposed this was all part of entering the magical world, but it had been a lot more comfortable saying "Voldemort" without worrying. 
2001 
2002 "What's your Quidditch team?" Ron asked. 
2003 
2004 "Er -- I don't know any," Harry confessed. 
2005 
2006 "What!" Ron looked dumbfounded. "Oh, you wait, it's the best game in the world --" And he was off, explaining all about the four balls and the positions of the seven players, describing famous games he'd been to with his brothers and the broomstick he'd like to get if he had the money. He was just taking Harry through the finer points of the game when the compartment door slid open yet again, but it wasn't Neville the toadless boy, or Hermione Granger this time. 
2007 
2008 Three boys entered, and Harry recognized the middle one at once: it was the pale boy from Madam Malkin's robe shop. He was looking at Harry with a lot more interest than he'd shown back in Diagon Alley. 
2009 
2010 "Is it true?" he said. "They're saying all down the train that Harry Potter's in this compartment. So it's you, is it?" 
2011 
2012 "Yes," said Harry. He was looking at the other boys. Both of them were thickset and looked extremely mean. Standing on either side of the pale boy, they looked like bodyguards. 
2013 
2014 "Oh, this is Crabbe and this is Goyle," said the pale boy carelessly, noticing where Harry was looking. "And my name's Malfoy, Draco Malfoy." 
2015 
2016 Ron gave a slight cough, which might have been hiding a snigget. Draco Malfoy looked at him. 
2017 
2018 "Think my name's funny, do you? No need to ask who you are. My father told me all the Weasleys have red hair, freckles, and more children than they can afford." 
2019 
2020 He turned back to Harry. "You'll soon find out some wizarding families are much better than others, Potter. You don't want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there." 
2021 
2022 He held out his hand to shake Harry's, but Harry didn't take it. 
2023 
2024 "I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks," he said coolly. 
2025 
2026 Draco Malfoy didn't go red, but a pink tinge appeared in his pale cheeks. 
2027 
2028 "I'd be careful if I were you, Potter," he said slowly. "Unless you're a bit politer you'll go the same way as your parents. They didn't know what was good for them, either. You hang around with riffraff like the Weasleys and that Hagrid, and it'll rub off on you." 
2029 
2030 Both Harry and Ron stood up. 
2031 
2032 "Say that again," Ron said, his face as red as his hair. 
2033 
2034 "Oh, you're going to fight us, are you?" Malfoy sneered. 
2035 
2036 "Unless you get out now," said Harry, more bravely than he felt, because Crabbe and Goyle were a lot bigger than him or Ron. 
2037 
2038 "But we don't feet like leaving, do we, boys? We've eaten all our food and you still seem to have some." 
2039 
2040 Goyle reached toward the Chocolate Frogs next to Ron - Ron leapt forward, but before he'd so much as touched Goyle, Goyle let out a horrible yell. 
2041 
2042 Scabbers the rat was hanging off his finger, sharp little teeth sunk deep into Goyle's knuckle - Crabbe and Malfoy backed away as Goyle swung Scabbers round and round, howling, and when Scabbets finally flew off and hit the window, all three of them disappeared at once. Perhaps they thought there were more rats lurking among the sweets, or perhaps they'd heard footsteps, because a second later, Hermione Granger had come in. 
2043 
2044 "What has been going on?" she said, looking at the sweets all over the floor and Ron picking up Scabbers by his tail. 
2045 
2046 I think he's been knocked out," Ron said to Harry. He looked closer at Scabbers. "No -- I don't believe it -- he's gone back to sleep-" 
2047 
2048 And so he had. 
2049 
2050 "You've met Malfoy before?" 
2051 
2052 Harry explained about their meeting in Diagon Alley. 
2053 
2054 "I've heard of his family," said Ron darkly. "They were some of the first to come back to our side after You-Know-Who disappeared. Said they'd been bewitched. My dad doesn't believe it. He says Malfoy's father didn't need an excuse to go over to the Dark Side." He turned to Hermione. "Can we help you with something?" 
2055 
2056 "You'd better hurry up and put your robes on, I've just been up to the front to ask the conductor, and he says we're nearly there. You haven't been fighting, have you? You'll be in trouble before we even get there!" 
2057 
2058 "Scabbers has been fighting, not us," said Ron, scowling at her. "Would you mind leaving while we change?" 
2059 
2060 "All right -- I only came in here because people outside are behaving very childishly, racing up and down the corridors," said Hermione in a sniffy voice. "And you've got dirt on your nose, by the way, did you know?" 
2061 
2062 Ron glared at her as she left. Harry peered out of the window. It was getting dark. He could see mountains and forests under a deep purple sky. The train did seem to be slowing down. 
2063 
2064 He and Ron took off their jackets and pulled on their long black robes. 
2065 
2066 Ron's were a bit short for him, you could see his sneakers underneath them. 
2067 
2068 A voice echoed through the train: "We will be reaching Hogwarts in five minutes' time. Please leave your luggage on the train, it will be taken to the school separately." 
2069 
2070 Harry's stomach lurched with nerves and Ron, he saw, looked pale under his freckles. They crammed their pockets with the last of the sweets and joined the crowd thronging the corridor. 
2071 
2072 The train slowed right down and finally stopped. People pushed their way toward the door and out on to a tiny, dark platform. Harry shivered in the cold night air. Then a lamp came bobbing over the heads of the students, and Harry heard a familiar voice: "Firs' years! Firs' years over here! All right there, Harry?" 
2073 
2074 Hagrid's big hairy face beamed over the sea of heads. 
2075 
2076 "C'mon, follow me -- any more firs' years? Mind yer step, now! Firs' years follow me!" 
2077 
2078 Slipping and stumbling, they followed Hagrid down what seemed to be a steep, narrow path. It was so dark on either side of them that Harry thought there must be thick trees there. Nobody spoke much. Neville, the boy who kept losing his toad, sniffed once or twice. 
2079 
2080 "Ye' all get yer firs' sight o' Hogwarts in a sec," Hagrid called over his shoulder, "jus' round this bend here." 
2081 
2082 There was a loud "Oooooh!" 
2083 
2084 The narrow path had opened suddenly onto the edge of a great black take. 
2085 
2086 Perched atop a high mountain on the other side, its windows sparkling in the starry sky, was a vast castle with many turrets and towers. 
2087 
2088 "No more'n four to a boat!" Hagrid called, pointing to a fleet of little boats sitting in the water by the shore. Harry and Ron were followed into their boat by Neville and Hermione. "Everyone in?" shouted Hagrid, who had a boat to himself. "Right then -- FORWARD!" 
2089 
2090 And the fleet of little boats moved off all at once, gliding across the lake, which was as smooth as glass. Everyone was silent, staring up at the great castle overhead. It towered over them as they sailed nearer and nearer to the cliff on which it stood. 
2091 
2092 "Heads down!" yelled Hagrid as the first boats reached the cliff; they all bent their heads and the little boats carried them through a curtain of ivy that hid a wide opening in the cliff face. They were carried along a dark tunnel, which seemed to be taking them right underneath the castle, until they reached a kind of underground harbor, where they clambered out onto rocks and pebbles. 
2093 
2094 "Oy, you there! Is this your toad?" said Hagrid, who was checking the boats as people climbed out of them. 
2095 
2096 "Trevor!" cried Neville blissfully, holding out his hands. Then they clambered up a passageway in the rock after Hagrid's lamp, coming out at last onto smooth, damp grass right in the shadow of the castle. 
2097 
2098 They walked up a flight of stone steps and crowded around the huge, Oak front door. 
2099 
2100 "Everyone here? You there, still got yer toad?" 
2101 
2102 Hagrid raised a gigantic fist and knocked three times on the castle door. 
2103 
2104 CHAPTER SEVEN 
2105 
2106 THE SORTING HAT 
2107 
2108 The door swung open at once. A tall, black-haired witch in emerald-green robes stood there. She had a very stern face and Harry's first thought was that this was not someone to cross. 
2109 
2110 "The firs' years, Professor McGonagall," said Hagrid. 
2111 
2112 "Thank you, Hagrid. I will take them from here." 
2113 
2114 She pulled the door wide. The entrance hall was so big you could have fit the whole of the Dursleys' house in it. The stone walls were lit with flaming torches like the ones at Gringotts, the ceiling was too high to make out, and a magnificent marble staircase facing them led to the upper floors. 
2115 
2116 They followed Professor McGonagall across the flagged stone floor. Harry could hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right -the rest of the school must already be here -- but Professor McGonagall showed the first years into a small, empty chamber off the hall. They crowded in, standing rather closer together than they would usually have done, peering about nervously. 
2117 
2118 "Welcome to Hogwarts," said Professor McGonagall. "The start-of-term banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall, you will be sorted into your houses. The Sorting is a very important ceremony because, while you are here, your house will be something like your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your house, sleep in your house dormitory, and spend free time in your house common room. 
2119 
2120 "The four houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Each house has its own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs will earn your house points, while any rulebreaking will lose house points. At the end of the year, the house with the most points is awarded the house cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever house becomes yours. 
2121 
2122 "The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest of the school. I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can while you are waiting." 
2123 
2124 Her eyes lingered for a moment on Neville's cloak, which was fastened under his left ear, and on Ron's smudged nose. Harry nervously tried to flatten his hair. 
2125 
2126 "I shall return when we are ready for you," said Professor McGonagall. 
2127 
2128 "Please wait quietly." 
2129 
2130 She left the chamber. Harry swallowed. 
2131 
2132 "How exactly do they sort us into houses?" he asked Ron. 
2133 
2134 "Some sort of test, I think. Fred said it hurts a lot, but I think he was joking." 
2135 
2136 Harry's heart gave a horrible jolt. A test? In front of the whole school? But he didn't know any magic yet -- what on earth would he have to do? He hadn't expected something like this the moment they arrived. 
2137 
2138 He looked around anxiously and saw that everyone else looked terrified, too. No one was talking much except Hermione Granger, who was whispering very fast about all the spells she'd learned and wondering which one she'd need. Harry tried hard not to listen to her. He'd never been more nervous, never, not even when he'd had to take a school report home to the Dursleys saying that he'd somehow turned his teacher's wig blue. He kept his eyes fixed on the door. Any second now, Professor McGonagall would come back and lead him to his doom. 
2139 
2140 Then something happened that made him jump about a foot in the air -- several people behind him screamed. 
2141 
2142 "What the --?" 
2143 
2144 He gasped. So did the people around him. About twenty ghosts had just streamed through the back wall. Pearly-white and slightly transparent, they glided across the room talking to one another and hardly glancing at the first years. They seemed to be arguing. What looked like a fat little monk was saying: "Forgive and forget, I say, we ought to give him a second chance --" 
2145 
2146 "My dear Friar, haven't we given Peeves all the chances he deserves? He gives us all a bad name and you know, he's not really even a ghost -- I say, what are you all doing here?" 
2147 
2148 A ghost wearing a ruff and tights had suddenly noticed the first years. 
2149 
2150 Nobody answered. 
2151 
2152 "New students!" said the Fat Friar, smiling around at them. "About to be Sorted, I suppose?" 
2153 
2154 A few people nodded mutely. 
2155 
2156 "Hope to see you in Hufflepuff!" said the Friar. "My old house, you know." 
2157 
2158 "Move along now," said a sharp voice. "The Sorting Ceremony's about to start." 
2159 
2160 Professor McGonagall had returned. One by one, the ghosts floated away through the opposite wall. 
2161 
2162 "Now, form a line," Professor McGonagall told the first years, "and follow me." 
2163 
2164 Feeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead, Harry got into line behind a boy with sandy hair, with Ron behind him, and they walked out of the chamber, back across the hall, and through a pair of double doors into the Great Hall. 
2165 
2166 Harry had never even imagined such a strange and splendid place. It was lit by thousands and thousands of candles that were floating in midair over four long tables, where the rest of the students were sitting. 
2167 
2168 These tables were laid with glittering golden plates and goblets. At the top of the hall was another long table where the teachers were sitting. 
2169 
2170 Professor McGonagall led the first years up here, so that they came to a halt in a line facing the other students, with the teachers behind them. 
2171 
2172 The hundreds of faces staring at them looked like pale lanterns in the flickering candlelight. Dotted here and there among the students, the ghosts shone misty silver. Mainly to avoid all the staring eyes, Harry looked upward and saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars. He heard Hermione whisper, "Its bewitched to look like the sky outside. I read about it in Hogwarts, A History." 
2173 
2174 It was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all, and that the Great Hall didn't simply open on to the heavens. 
2175 
2176 Harry quickly looked down again as Professor McGonagall silently placed a four-legged stool in front of the first years. On top of the stool she put a pointed wizard's hat. This hat was patched and frayed and extremely dirty. Aunt Petunia wouldn't have let it in the house. 
2177 
2178 Maybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it, Harry thought wildly, that seemed the sort of thing -- noticing that everyone in the hall was now staring at the hat, he stared at it, too. For a few seconds, there was complete silence. Then the hat twitched. A rip near the brim opened wide like a mouth -- and the hat began to sing: "Oh, you may not think I'm pretty, But don't judge on what you see, I'll eat myself if you can find A smarter hat than me. 
2179 
2180 You can keep your bowlers black, Your top hats sleek and tall, For I'm the Hogwarts Sorting Hat And I can cap them all. 
2181 
2182 There's nothing hidden in your head The Sorting Hat can't see, So try me on and I will tell you Where you ought to be. 
2183 
2184 You might belong in Gryffindor, Where dwell the brave at heart, Their daring, nerve, and chivalry Set Gryffindors apart; You might belong in Hufflepuff, Where they are just and loyal, Those patient Hufflepuffis are true And unafraid of toil; Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw, if you've a ready mind, Where those of wit and learning, Will always find their kind; Or perhaps in Slytherin You'll make your real friends, Those cunning folk use any means To achieve their ends. 
2185 
2186 So put me on! Don't be afraid! And don't get in a flap! You're in safe hands (though I have none) For I'm a Thinking Cap!" 
2187 
2188 The whole hall burst into applause as the hat finished its song. It bowed to each of the four tables and then became quite still again. 
2189 
2190 "So we've just got to try on the hat!" Ron whispered to Harry. "I'll kill Fred, he was going on about wrestling a troll." 
2191 
2192 Harry. smiled weakly. Yes, trying on the hat was a lot better than having to do a spell, but he did wish they could have tried it on without everyone watching. The hat seemed to be asking rather alot; Harry didn't feel brave or quick-witted or any of it at the moment. If only the hat had mentioned a house for people who felt a bit queasy, that would have been the one for him. 
2193 
2194 Professor McGonagall now stepped forward holding a long roll of parchment. 
2195 
2196 "When I call your name, you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to be sorted," she said. "Abbott, Hannah!" 
2197 
2198 A pink-faced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of line, put on the hat, which fell right down over her eyes, and sat down. A moments pause -- "HUFFLEPUFF!" shouted the hat. 
2199 
2200 The table on the right cheered and clapped as Hannah went to sit down at the Hufflepuff table. Harry saw the ghost of the Fat Friar waving merrily at her. 
2201 
2202 "Bones, Susan!" 
2203 
2204 "HUFFLEPUFF!" shouted the hat again, and Susan scuttled off to sit next to Hannah. 
2205 
2206 "Boot, Terry!" 
2207 
2208 "RAVENCLAW!" 
2209 
2210 The table second from the left clapped this time; several Ravenclaws stood up to shake hands with Terry as he joined them. 
2211 
2212 " Brocklehurst, Mandy" went to Ravenclaw too, but "Brown, Lavender" 
2213 
2214 became the first new Gryffindor, and the table on the far left exploded with cheers; Harry could see Ron's twin brothers catcalling. 
2215 
2216 "Bulstrode, Millicent" then became a Slytherin. Perhaps it was Harry's imagination, after all he'd heard about Slytherin, but he thought they looked like an unpleasant lot. He was starting to feel definitely sick now. He remembered being picked for teams during gym at his old school. 
2217 
2218 He had always been last to be chosen, not because he was no good, but because no one wanted Dudley to think they liked him. 
2219 
2220 "Finch-Fletchley, Justin!" 
2221 
2222 "HUFFLEPUFF!" 
2223 
2224 Sometimes, Harry noticed, the hat shouted out the house at once, but at others it took a little while to decide. "Finnigan, Seamus," the sandy-haired boy next to Harry in the line, sat on the stool for almost a whole minute before the hat declared him a Gryffindor. 
2225 
2226 "Granger, Hermione!" 
2227 
2228 Hermione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat eagerly on her head. 
2229 
2230 "GRYFFINDOR!" shouted the hat. Ron groaned. 
2231 
2232 A horrible thought struck Harry, as horrible thoughts always do when you're very nervous. What if he wasn't chosen at all? What if he just sat there with the hat over his eyes for ages, until Professor McGonagall jerked it off his head and said there had obviously been a mistake and he'd better get back on the train? When Neville Longbottom, the boy who kept losing his toad, was called, he fell over on his way to the stool. The hat took a long time to decide with Neville. When it finally shouted, "GRYFFINDOR," Neville ran off still wearing it, and had to jog back amid gales of laughter to give it to "MacDougal, Morag." 
2233 
2234 Malfoy swaggered forward when his name was called and got his wish at once: the hat had barely touched his head when it screamed, "SLYTHERIN!" 
2235 
2236 Malfoy went to join his friends Crabbe and Goyle, looking pleased with himself. 
2237 
2238 There weren't many people left now. "Moon" "Nott" "Parkinson" then a pair of twin girls, "Patil" and "Patil" then "Perks, Sally-Anne" and then, at last -- "Potter, Harry!" 
2239 
2240 As Harry stepped forward, whispers suddenly broke out like little hissing fires all over the hall. 
2241 
2242 "Potter, did she say?" 
2243 
2244 The Harry Potter?" 
2245 
2246 The last thing Harry saw before the hat dropped over his eyes was the hall full of people craning to get a good look at him. Next second he was looking at the black inside of the hat. He waited. 
2247 
2248 Hmm," said a small voice in his ear. "Difficult. Very difficult. Plenty of courage, I see. Not a bad mind either. There's talent, A my goodness, yes -- and a nice thirst to prove yourself, now that's interesting.... 
2249 
2250 So where shall I put you?" 
2251 
2252 Harry gripped the edges of the stool and thought, Not Slytherin, not Slytherin. 
2253 
2254 "Not Slytherin, eh?" said the small voice. "Are you sure? You could be great, you know, it's all here in your head, and Slytherin will help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about that -- no? Well, if you're sure -- better be GRYFFINDOR!" 
2255 
2256 Harry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole hall. He took off the hat and walked shakily toward the Gryffindor table. He was so relieved to have been chosen and not put in Slytherin, he hardly noticed that he was getting the loudest cheer yet. Percy the Prefect got up and shook his hand vigorously, while the Weasley twins yelled, "We got Potter! We got Potter!" Harry sat down opposite the ghost in the ruff he'd seen earlier. The ghost patted his arm, giving Harry the sudden, horrible feeling he'd just plunged it into a bucket of ice-cold water. 
2257 
2258 He could see the High Table properly now. At the end nearest him sat Hagrid, who caught his eye and gave him the thumbs up. Harry grinned back. And there, in the center of the High Table, in a large gold chair, sat Albus Dumbledore. Harry recognized him at once from the card he'd gotten out of the Chocolate Frog on the train. Dumbledore's silver hair was the only thing in the whole hall that shone as brightly as the ghosts. Harry spotted Professor Quirtell, too, the nervous young man from the Leaky Cauldron. He was looking very peculiar in a large purple turban. 
2259 
2260 And now there were only three people left to be sorted. "Thomas, Dean," 
2261 
2262 a Black boy even taller than Ron, joined Harry at the Gryffindor table. 
2263 
2264 "Turpin, Lisa," became a Ravenclaw and then it was Ron's turn. He was pale green by now. Harry crossed his fingers under the table and a second later the hat had shouted, "GRYFFINDOR!" 
2265 
2266 Harry clapped loudly with the rest as Ron collapsed into the chair next to him. 
2267 
2268 "Well done, Ron, excellent," said Percy Weasley Pompously across Harry as "Zabini, Blaise," was made a Slytherin. Professor McGonagall rolled up her scroll and took the Sorting Hat away. 
2269 
2270 Harry looked down at his empty gold plate. He had only just realized how hungry he was. The pumpkin pasties seemed ages ago. 
2271 
2272 Albus Dumbledore had gotten to his feet. He was beaming at the students, his arms opened wide, as if nothing could have pleased him more than to see them all there. 
2273 
2274 "Welcome," he said. "Welcome to a new year at Hogwarts! Before we begin our banquet, I would like to say a few words. And here they are: Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak! "Thank you!" 
2275 
2276 He sat back down. Everybody clapped and cheered. Harry didn't know whether to laugh or not. 
2277 
2278 "Is he -- a bit mad?" he asked Percy uncertainly. 
2279 
2280 "Mad?" said Percy airily. "He's a genius! Best wizard in the world! But he is a bit mad, yes. Potatoes, Harry?" 
2281 
2282 Harry's mouth fell open. The dishes in front of him were now piled with food. He had never seen so many things he liked to eat on one table: roast beef, roast chicken, pork chops and lamb chops, sausages, bacon and steak, boiled potatoes, roast potatoes, fries, Yorkshire pudding, peas, carrots, gravy, ketchup, and, for some strange reason, peppermint humbugs. 
2283 
2284 The Dursleys had never exactly starved Harry, but he'd never been allowed to eat as much as he liked. Dudley had always taken anything that Harry really wanted, even if It made him sick. Harry piled his plate with a bit of everything except the peppermints and began to eat. 
2285 
2286 It was all delicious. 
2287 
2288 "That does look good," said the ghost in the ruff sadly, watching Harry cut up his steak, "Can't you --?" 
2289 
2290 I haven't eaten for nearly four hundred years," said the ghost. "I don't need to, of course, but one does miss it. I don't think I've in troduced myself? Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington at your service. Resident ghost of Gryffindor Tower." 
2291 
2292 "I know who you are!" said Ron suddenly. "My brothers told me about you -- you're Nearly Headless Nick!" 
2293 
2294 "I would prefer you to call me Sir Nicholas de Mimsy --" the ghost began stiffly, but sandy-haired Seamus Finnigan interrupted. 
2295 
2296 "Nearly Headless? How can you be nearly headless?" 
2297 
2298 Sir Nicholas looked extremely miffed, as if their little chat wasn't going at all the way he wanted. 
2299 
2300 "Like this," he said irritably. He seized his left ear and pulled. His whole head swung off his neck and fell onto his shoulder as if it was on a hinge. Someone had obviously tried to behead him, but not done it properly. Looking pleased at the stunned looks on their faces, Nearly Headless Nick flipped his head back onto his neck, coughed, and said, "So -- new Gryffindors! I hope you're going to help us win the house championship this year? Gryffindors have never gone so long without winning. Slytherins have got the cup six years in a row! The Bloody Baron's becoming almost unbearable -- he's the Slytherin ghost." 
2301 
2302 Harry looked over at the Slytherin table and saw a horrible ghost sitting there, with blank staring eyes, a gaunt face, and robes stained with silver blood. He was right next to Malfoy who, Harry was pleased to see, didn't look too pleased with the seating arrangements. 
2303 
2304 "How did he get covered in blood?" asked Seamus with great interest. 
2305 
2306 "I've never asked," said Nearly Headless Nick delicately. 
2307 
2308 When everyone had eaten as much as they could, the remains of the food faded from the plates, leaving them sparkling clean as before. A moment later the desserts appeared. Blocks of ice cream in every flavor you could think of, apple pies, treacle tarts, chocolate eclairs and jam doughnuts, trifle, strawberries, Jell-O, rice pudding -- � 
2309 
2310 As Harry helped himself to a treacle tart, the talk turned to their families. 
2311 
2312 "I'm half-and-half," said Seamus. "Me dad's a Muggle. Mom didn't tell him she was a witch 'til after they were married. Bit of a nasty shock for him." 
2313 
2314 The others laughed. 
2315 
2316 "What about you, Neville?" said Ron. 
2317 
2318 "Well, my gran brought me up and she's a witch," said Neville, "but the family thought I was all- Muggle for ages. My Great Uncle Algie kept trying to catch me off my guard and force some magic out of me -- he pushed me off the end of Blackpool pier once, I nearly drowned -- but nothing happened until I was eight. Great Uncle Algie came round for dinner, and he was hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles when my Great Auntie Enid offered him a meringue and he accidentally let go. But I bounced -- all the way down the garden and into the road. They were all really pleased, Gran was crying, she was so happy. And you should have seen their faces when I got in here -- they thought I might not be magic enough to come, you see. Great Uncle Algie was so pleased he bought me my toad." 
2319 
2320 On Harry's other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione were talking about lessons ("I do hope they start right away, there's so much to learn, I'm particularly interested in Transfiguration, you know, turning something into something else, of course, it's supposed to be very difficult-"; "You'll be starting small, just matches into needles and that sort of thing -- "). 
2321 
2322 Harry, who was starting to feel warm and sleepy, looked up at the High Table again. Hagrid was drinking deeply from his goblet. 
2323 
2324 Professor McGonagall was talking to Professor Dumbledore. Professor Quirrell, in his absurd turban, was talking to a teacher with greasy black hair, a hooked nose, and sallow skin. 
2325 
2326 It happened very suddenly. The hook-nosed teacher looked past Quirrell's turban straight into Harry's eyes -- and a sharp, hot pain shot across the scar on Harry's forehead. 
2327 
2328 "Ouch!" Harry clapped a hand to his head. 
2329 
2330 "What is it?" asked Percy. 
2331 
2332 "N-nothing." 
2333 
2334 The pain had gone as quickly as it had come. Harder to shake off was the feeling Harry had gotten from the teacher's look -- a feeling that he didn't like Harry at all. 
2335 
2336 "Who's that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?" he asked Percy. 
2337 
2338 "Oh, you know Quirrell already, do you? No wonder he's looking so nervous, that's Professor Snape. He teaches Potions, but he doesn't want to -- everyone knows he's after Quirrell's job. Knows an awful lot about the Dark Arts, Snape." 
2339 
2340 Harry watched Snape for a while, but Snape didn't look at him again. 
2341 
2342 At last, the desserts too disappeared, and Professor Dumbledore got to his feet again. The hall fell silent. 
2343 
2344 "Ahern -- just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered. I have a few start-of-term notices to give you. 
2345 
2346 "First years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all pupils. And a few of our older students would do well to remember that as well." 
2347 
2348 Dumbledore's twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the Weasley twins. 
2349 
2350 "I have also been asked by Mr. Filch, the caretaker, to remind you all that no magic should be used between classes in the corridors. 
2351 
2352 "Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term. Anyone interested in playing for their house teams should contact Madam Hooch. 
2353 
2354 "And finally, I must tell you that this year, the third-floor corridor on the right-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very painful death." 
2355 
2356 Harry laughed, but he was one of the few who did. 
2357 
2358 "He's not serious?" he muttered to Percy. 
2359 
2360 "Must be," said Percy, frowning at Dumbledore. "It's odd, because he usually gives us a reason why we're not allowed to go somewhere -- the forest's full of dangerous beasts, everyone knows that. I do think he might have told us prefects, at least." 
2361 
2362 "And now, before we go to bed, let us sing the school song!" cried Dumbledore. Harry noticed that the other teachers' smiles had become rather fixed. 
2363 
2364 Dumbledore gave his wand a little flick, as if he was trying to get a fly off the end, and a long golden ribbon flew out of it, which rose high above the tables and twisted itself, snakelike, into words. 
2365 
2366 "Everyone pick their favorite tune," said Dumbledore, "and off we go!" 
2367 
2368 And the school bellowed: "Hogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts, Teach us something please, Whether we be old and bald Or young with scabby knees, Our heads could do with filling With some interesting stuff, For now they're bare and full of air, Dead flies and bits of fluff, So teach us things worth knowing, Bring back what we've forgot, just do your best, we'll do the rest, And learn until our brains all rot. 
2369 
2370 Everybody finished the song at different times. At last, only the Weasley twins were left singing along to a very slow funeral march. 
2371 
2372 Dumbledore conducted their last few lines with his wand and when they had finished, he was one of those who clapped loudest. 
2373 
2374 "Ah, music," he said, wiping his eyes. "A magic beyond all we do here! And now, bedtime. Off you trot!" 
2375 
2376 The Gryffindor first years followed Percy through the chattering crowds, out of the Great Hall, and up the marble staircase. Harry's legs were like lead again, but only because he was so tired and full of food. He was too sleepy even to be surprised that the people in the portraits along the corridors whispered and pointed as they passed, or that twice Percy led them through doorways hidden behind sliding panels and hanging tapestries. They climbed more staircases, yawning and dragging their feet, and Harry was just wondering how much farther they had to go when they came to a sudden halt. 
2377 
2378 A bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair ahead of them, and as Percy took a step toward them they started throwing themselves at him. 
2379 
2380 "Peeves," Percy whispered to the first years. "A poltergeist." He raised his voice, "Peeves -- show yourself" 
2381 
2382 A loud, rude sound, like the air being let out of a balloon, answered. 
2383 
2384 "Do you want me to go to the Bloody Baron?" 
2385 
2386 There was a pop, and a little man with wicked, dark eyes and a wide mouth appeared, floating cross- legged in the air, clutching the walking sticks. 
2387 
2388 "Oooooooh!" he said, with an evil cackle. "Ickle Firsties! What fun!" 
2389 
2390 He swooped suddenly at them. They all ducked. 
2391 
2392 "Go away, Peeves, or the Baron'll hear about this, I mean it!" barked Percy. 
2393 
2394 Peeves stuck out his tongue and vanished, dropping the walking sticks on Neville's head. They heard him zooming away, rattling coats of armor as he passed. 
2395 
2396 "You want to watch out for Peeves," said Percy, as they set off again. 
2397 
2398 "The Bloody Baron's the only one who can control him, he won't even listen to us prefects. Here we are." 
2399 
2400 At the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a very fat woman in a pink silk dress. 
2401 
2402 "Password?" she said. "Caput Draconis," said Percy, and the portrait swung forward to reveal a round hole in the wall. They all scrambled through it -- Neville needed a leg up -- and found themselves in the Gryffindor common room, a cozy, round room full of squashy armchairs. 
2403 
2404 Percy directed the girls through one door to their dormitory and the boys through another. At the top of a spiral staircase -- they were obviously in one of the towers -- they found their beds at last: five four-posters hung with deep red, velvet curtains. Their trunks had already been brought up. Too tired to talk much, they pulled on their pajamas and fell into bed. 
2405 
2406 " Great food, isn't it?" Ron muttered to Harry through the hangings. 
2407 
2408 "Get off, Scabbers! He's chewing my sheets." 
2409 
2410 Harry was going to ask Ron if he'd had any of the treacle tart, but he fell asleep almost at once. 
2411 
2412 Perhaps Harry had eaten a bit too much, because he had a very strange dream. He was wearing Professor Quirrell's turban, which kept talking to him, telling him he must transfer to Slytherin at once, because it was his destiny. Harry told the turban he didn't want to be in Slytherin; it got heavier and heavier; he tried to pull it off but it tightened painfully -- and there was Malfoy, laughing at him as he struggled with it -then Malfoy turned into the hook-nosed teacher, Snape, whose laugh became high and cold -- there was a burst of green light and Harry woke, sweating and shaking. 
2413 
2414 He rolled over and fell asleep again, and when he woke next day, he didn't remember the dream at all. 
2415 
2416 CHAPTER EIGHT 
2417 
2418 THE POTIONS MASTER 
2419 
2420 There, look." 
2421 
2422 "Where?" 
2423 
2424 "Next to the tall kid with the red hair." 
2425 
2426 "Wearing the glasses?" 
2427 
2428 "Did you see his face?" 
2429 
2430 "Did you see his scar?" 
2431 
2432 Whispers followed Harry from the moment he left his dormitory the next day. People lining up outside classrooms stood on tiptoe to get a look at him, or doubled back to pass him in the corridors again, staring. 
2433 
2434 Harry wished they wouldn't, because he was trying to concentrate on finding his way to classes. 
2435 
2436 There were a hundred and forty-two staircases at Hogwarts: wide, sweeping ones; narrow, rickety ones; some that led somewhere different on a Friday; some with a vanishing step halfway up that you had to remember to jump. Then there were doors that wouldn't open unless you asked politely, or tickled them in exactly the right place, and doors that weren't really doors at all, but solid walls just pretending. It was also very hard to remember where anything was, because it all seemed to move around a lot. The people in the portraits kept going to visit each other, and Harry was sure the coats of armor could walk. 
2437 
2438 The ghosts didn't help, either. It was always a nasty shock when one of them glided suddenly through a door you were trying to open. Nearly Headless Nick was always happy to point new Gryffindors in the right direction, but Peeves the Poltergeist was worth two locked doors and a trick staircase if you met him when you were late for class. He would drop wastepaper baskets on your head, pull rugs from under your feet, pelt you with bits of chalk, or sneak up behind you, invisible, grab your nose, and screech, "GOT YOUR CONK!" 
2439 
2440 Even worse than Peeves, if that was possible, was the caretaker, Argus Filch. Harry and Ron managed to get on the wrong side of him on their very first morning. Filch found them trying to force their way through a door that unluckily turned out to be the entrance to the out-of-bounds corridor on the third floor. He wouldn't believe they were lost, was sure they were trying to break into it on purpose, and was threatening to lock them in the dungeons when they were rescued by Professor Quirrell, who was passing. 
2441 
2442 Filch owned a cat called Mrs. Norris, a scrawny, dust-colored creature with bulging, lamp like eyes just like Filch's. She patrolled the corridors alone. Break a rule in front of her, put just one toe out of line, and she'd whisk off for Filch, who'd appear, wheezing, two seconds later. Filch knew the secret passageways of the school better than anyone (except perhaps the Weasley twins) and could pop up as suddenly as any of the ghosts. The students all hated him, and it was the dearest ambition of many to give Mrs. Norris a good kick. 
2443 
2444 And then, once you had managed to find them, there were the classes themselves. There was a lot more to magic, as Harry quickly found out, than waving your wand and saying a few funny words. 
2445 
2446 They had to study the night skies through their telescopes every Wednesday at midnight and learn the names of different stars and the movements of the planets. Three times a week they went out to the greenhouses behind the castle to study Herbology, with a dumpy little witch called Professor Sprout, where they learned how to take care of all the strange plants and fungi, and found out what they were used for. 
2447 
2448 Easily the most boring class was History of Magic, which was the only one taught by a ghost. Professor Binns had been very old indeed when he had fallen asleep in front of the staff room fire and got up next morning to teach, leaving his body behind him. Binns droned on and on while they scribbled down names and dates, and got Emetic the Evil and Uric the Oddball mixed up. 
2449 
2450 Professor Flitwick, the Charms teacher, was a tiny little wizard who had to stand on a pile of books to see over his desk. At the start of their first class he took the roll call, and when he reached Harry's name he gave an excited squeak and toppled out of sight. 
2451 
2452 Professor McGonagall was again different. Harry had been quite right to think she wasn't a teacher to cross. Strict and clever, she gave them a talking-to the moment they sat down in her first class. 
2453 
2454 "Transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you will learn at Hogwarts," she said. "Anyone messing around in my class will leave and not come back. You have been warned." 
2455 
2456 Then she changed her desk into a pig and back again. They were all very impressed and couldn't wait to get started, but soon realized they weren't going to be changing the furniture into animals for a long time. 
2457 
2458 After taking a lot of complicated notes, they were each given a match and started trying to turn it into a needle. By the end of the lesson, only Hermione Granger had made any difference to her match; Professor McGonagall showed the class how it had gone all silver and pointy and gave Hermione a rare smile. 
2459 
2460 The class everyone had really been looking forward to was Defense Against the Dark Arts, but Quirrell's lessons turned out to be a bit of a joke. His classroom smelled strongly of garlic, which everyone said was to ward off a vampire he'd met in Romania and was afraid would be coming back to get him one of these days. His turban, he told them, had been given to him by an African prince as a thank-you for getting rid of a troublesome zombie, but they weren't sure they believed this story. 
2461 
2462 For one thing, when Seamus Finnigan asked eagerly to hear how Quirrell had fought off the zombie, Quirrell went pink and started talking about the weather; for another, they had noticed that a funny smell hung around the turban, and the Weasley twins insisted that it was stuffed full of garlic as well, so that Quirrell was protected wherever he went. 
2463 
2464 Harry was very relieved to find out that he wasn't miles behind everyone else. Lots of people had come from Muggle families and, like him, hadn't had any idea that they were witches and wizards. There was so much to learn that even people like Ron didn't have much of a head start. 
2465 
2466 Friday was an important day for Harry and Ron. They finally managed to find their way down to the Great Hall for breakfast without getting lost once. 
2467 
2468 "What have we got today?" Harry asked Ron as he poured sugar on his porridge. 
2469 
2470 "Double Potions with the Slytherins," said Ron. "Snape's Head of Slytherin House. They say he always favors them -- we'll be able to see if it's true." 
2471 
2472 "Wish McGonagall favored us, " said Harry. Professor McGonagall was head of Gryffindor House, but it hadn't stopped her from giving them a huge pile of homework the day before. 
2473 
2474 Just then, the mail arrived. Harry had gotten used to this by now, but it had given him a bit of a shock on the first morning, when about a hundred owls had suddenly streamed into the Great Hall during breakfast, circling the tables until they saw their owners, and dropping letters and packages onto their laps. 
2475 
2476 Hedwig hadn't brought Harry anything so far. She sometimes flew in to nibble his ear and have a bit of toast before going off to sleep in the owlery with the other school owls. This morning, however, she fluttered down between the marmalade and the sugar bowl and dropped a note onto Harry's plate. Harry tore it open at once. It said, in a very untidy scrawl: Dear Harry, I know you get Friday afternoons off, so would you like to come and have a cup of tea with me around three? I want to hear all about your first week. Send us an answer back with Hedwig. 
2477 
2478 Hagrid Harry borrowed Ron's quill, scribbled Yes, please, see you later on the back of the note, and sent Hedwig off again. 
2479 
2480 It was lucky that Harry had tea with Hagrid to look forward to, because the Potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that had happened to him so far. 
2481 
2482 At the start-of-term banquet, Harry had gotten the idea that Professor Snape disliked him. By the end of the first Potions lesson, he knew he'd been wrong. Snape didn't dislike Harry -- he hated him. 
2483 
2484 Potions lessons took place down in one of the dungeons. It was colder here than up in the main castle, and would have been quite creepy enough without the pickled animals floating in glass jars all around the walls. 
2485 
2486 Snape, like Flitwick, started the class by taking the roll call, and like Flitwick, he paused at Harry's name. 
2487 
2488 "Ah, Yes," he said softly, "Harry Potter. Our new -- celebrity." 
2489 
2490 Draco Malfoy and his friends Crabbe and Goyle sniggered behind their hands. Snape finished calling the names and looked up at the class. His eyes were black like Hagrid's, but they had none of Hagrid's warmth. 
2491 
2492 They were cold and empty and made you think of dark tunnels. 
2493 
2494 "You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potionmaking," he began. He spoke in barely more than a whisper, but they caught every word -- like Professor McGonagall, Snape had y caught every word -- like Professor McGonagall, Snape had the gift of keeping a class silent without effort. "As there is little foolish wand-waving here, many of you will hardly believe this is magic. I don't expect you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that creep through human veins, bewitching the mind, ensnaring the senses.... I can teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper death -- if you aren't as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach." 
2495 
2496 More silence followed this little speech. Harry and Ron exchanged looks with raised eyebrows. Hermione Granger was on the edge of her seat and looked desperate to start proving that she wasn't a dunderhead. 
2497 
2498 "Potter!" said Snape suddenly. "What would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?" 
2499 
2500 Powdered root of what to an infusion of what? Harry glanced at Ron, who looked as stumped as he was; Hermione's hand had shot into the air. 
2501 
2502 "I don't know, sit," said Harry. 
2503 
2504 Snape's lips curled into a sneer. 
2505 
2506 "Tut, tut -- fame clearly isn't everything." 
2507 
2508 He ignored Hermione's hand. 
2509 
2510 "Let's try again. Potter, where would you look if I told you to find me a bezoar?" 
2511 
2512 Hermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it would go without her leaving her seat, but Harry didn't have the faintest idea what a bezoar was. He tried not to look at Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, who were shaking with laughter. 
2513 
2514 "I don't know, sit." "Thought you wouldn't open a book before coming, eh, Potter?" Harry forced himself to keep looking straight into those cold eyes. He had looked through his books at the Dursleys', but did Snape expect him to remember everything in One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi? Snape was still ignoring Hermione's quivering hand. 
2515 
2516 "What is the difference, Potter, between monkshood and wolfsbane?" 
2517 
2518 At this, Hermione stood up, her hand stretching toward the dungeon ceiling. 
2519 
2520 "I don't know," said Harry quietly. "I think Hermione does, though, why don't you try her?" 
2521 
2522 A few people laughed; Harry caught Seamus's eye, and Seamus winked. 
2523 
2524 Snape, however, was not pleased. 
2525 
2526 "Sit down," he snapped at Hermione. "For your information, Potter, asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the Draught of Living Death. A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons. As for monkshood and wolfsbane, they are the same plant, which also goes by the name of aconite. Well? Why aren't you all copying that down?" 
2527 
2528 There was a sudden rummaging for quills and parchment. Over the noise, Snape said, "And a point will be taken from Gryffindor House for your cheek, Potter." 
2529 
2530 Things didn't improve for the Gryffindors as the Potions lesson continued. Snape put them all into pairs and set them to mixing up a simple potion to cure boils. He swept around in his long black cloak, watching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake fangs, criticizing almost everyone except Malfoy, whom he seemed to like. He was just telling everyone to look at the perfect way Malfoy had stewed his horned slugs when clouds of acid green smoke and a loud hissing filled the dungeon. Neville had somehow managed to melt Seamus's cauldron into a twisted blob, and their potion was seeping across the stone floor, burning holes in people's shoes. Within seconds, the whole class was standing on their stools while Neville, who had been drenched in the potion when the cauldron collapsed, moaned in pain as angry red boils sprang up all over his arms and legs. 
2531 
2532 "Idiot boy!" snarled Snape, clearing the spilled potion away with one wave of his wand. "I suppose you added the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron off the fire?" 
2533 
2534 Neville whimpered as boils started to pop up all over his nose. 
2535 
2536 "Take him up to the hospital wing," Snape spat at Seamus. Then he rounded on Harry and Ron, who had been working next to Neville. 
2537 
2538 "You -- Potter -- why didn't you tell him not to add the quills? Thought he'd make you look good if he got it wrong, did you? That's another point you've lost for Gryffindor." 
2539 
2540 This was so unfair that Harry opened his mouth to argue, but Ron kicked him behind their cauldron. 
2541 
2542 "Doi* push it," he muttered, "I've heard Snape can turn very nasty." 
2543 
2544 As they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour later, Harry's mind was racing and his spirits were low. He'd lost two points for Gryffindor in his very first week -- why did Snape hate him so much? "Cheer up," 
2545 
2546 said Ron, "Snape's always taking points off Fred and George. Can I come and meet Hagrid with you?" 
2547 
2548 At five to three they left the castle and made their way across the grounds. Hagrid lived in a small wooden house on the edge of the forbidden forest. A crossbow and a pair of galoshes were outside the front door. 
2549 
2550 When Harry knocked they heard a frantic scrabbling from inside and several booming barks. Then Hagrid's voice rang out, saying, "Back, Fang -- back." 
2551 
2552 Hagrid's big, hairy face appeared in the crack as he pulled the door open. 
2553 
2554 "Hang on," he said. "Back, Fang." 
2555 
2556 He let them in, struggling to keep a hold on the collar of an enormous black boarhound. 
2557 
2558 There was only one room inside. Hams and pheasants were hanging from the ceiling, a copper kettle was boiling on the open fire, and in the corner stood a massive bed with a patchwork quilt over it. 
2559 
2560 "Make yerselves at home," said Hagrid, letting go of Fang, who bounded straight at Ron and started licking his ears. Like Hagrid, Fang was clearly not as fierce as he looked. 
2561 
2562 "This is Ron," Harry told Hagrid, who was pouring boiling water into a large teapot and putting rock cakes onto a plate. 
2563 
2564 "Another Weasley, eh?" said Hagrid, glancing at Ron's freckles. I spent half me life chasin' yer twin brothers away from the forest." 
2565 
2566 The rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins that almost broke their teeth, but Harry and Ron pretended to be enjoying them as they told Hagrid all about their first -lessons. Fang rested his head on Harry's knee and drooled all over his robes. 
2567 
2568 Harry and Ron were delighted to hear Hagrid call Fitch "that old git." 
2569 
2570 "An' as fer that cat, Mrs. Norris, I'd like ter introduce her to Fang sometime. D'yeh know, every time I go up ter the school, she follows me everywhere? Can't get rid of her -- Fitch puts her up to it." 
2571 
2572 Harry told Hagrid about Snape's lesson. Hagrid, like Ron, told Harry not to worry about it, that Snape liked hardly any of the students. 
2573 
2574 "But he seemed to really hate me." 
2575 
2576 "Rubbish!" said Hagrid. "Why should he?" 
2577 
2578 Yet Harry couldn't help thinking that Hagrid didn't quite meet his eyes when he said that. 
2579 
2580 "How's yer brother Charlie?" Hagrid asked Ron. "I liked him a lot -- great with animals." 
2581 
2582 Harry wondered if Hagrid had changed the subject on purpose. While Ron told Hagrid all about Charlie's work with dragons, Harry picked up a piece of paper that was lying on the table under the tea cozy. It was a cutting from the Daily Prophet: GRINGOTTS BREAK-IN LATEST Investigations continue into the break-in at Gringotts on 31 July, widely believed to be the work of Dark wizards or witches unknown. 
2583 
2584 Gringotts goblins today insisted that nothing had been taken. The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied the same day. 
2585 
2586 "But we're not telling you what was in there, so keep your noses out if you know what's good for you," said a Gringotts spokesgoblin this afternoon. 
2587 
2588 Harry remembered Ron telling him on the train that someone had tried to rob Gringotts, but Ron hadn't mentioned the date. 
2589 
2590 "Hagrid!" said Harry, "that Gringotts break-in happened on my birthday! It might've been happening while we were there!" 
2591 
2592 There was no doubt about it, Hagrid definitely didn't meet Harry's eyes this time. He grunted and offered him another rock cake. Harry read the story again. The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied earlier that same day. Hagrid had emptied vault seven hundred and thirteen, if you could call it emptying, taking out that grubby little package. Had that been what the thieves were looking for? As Harry and Ron walked back to the castle for dinner, their pockets weighed down with rock cakes they'd been too polite to refuse, Harry thought that none of the lessons he'd had so far had given him as much to think about as tea with Hagrid. Had Hagrid collected that package just in time? Where was it now? And did Hagrid know something about Snape that he didn't want to tell Harry? CHAPTER NINE 
2593 
2594 THE MIDNIGHT DUEL 
2595 
2596 Harry had never believed he would meet a boy he hated more than Dudley, but that was before he met Draco Malfoy. Still, first-year Gryffindors only had Potions with the Slytherins, so they didn't have to put up with Malfoy much. Or at least, they didn't until they spotted a notice pinned up in the Gryffindor common room that made them all groan. 
2597 
2598 Flying lessons would be starting on Thursday -- and Gryffindor and Slytherin would be learning together. 
2599 
2600 "Typical," said Harry darkly. "Just what I always wanted. To make a fool of myself on a broomstick in front of Malfoy." 
2601 
2602 He had been looking forward to learning to fly more than anything else. 
2603 
2604 "You don't know that you'll make a fool of yourself," said Ron reasonably. "Anyway, I know Malfoy's always going on about how good he is at Quidditch, but I bet that's all talk." 
2605 
2606 Malfay certainly did talk about flying a lot. He complained loudly about first years never getting on the house Quidditch teams and told long, boastful stories that always seemed to end with him narrowly escaping Muggles in helicopters. He wasn't the only one, though: the way Seamus Finnigan told it, he'd spent most of his childhood zooming around the countryside on his broomstick. Even Ron would tell anyone who'd listen about the time he'd almost hit a hang glider on Charlie's old broom. 
2607 
2608 Everyone from wizarding families talked about Quidditch constantly. Ron had already had a big argument with Dean Thomas, who shared their dormitory, about soccer. Ron couldn't see what was exciting about a game with only one ball where no one was allowed to fly. Harry had caught Ron prodding Dean's poster of West Ham soccer team, trying to make the players move. 
2609 
2610 Neville had never been on a broomstick in his life, because his grandmother had never let him near one. Privately, Harry felt she'd had good reason, because Neville managed to have an extraordinary number of accidents even with both feet on the ground. 
2611 
2612 Hermione Granger was almost as nervous about flying as Neville was. This was something you couldn't learn by heart out of a book -- not that she hadn't tried. At breakfast on Thursday she bored them all stupid with flying tips she'd gotten out of a library book called Quidditch Through the Ages. Neville was hanging on to her every word, desperate for anything that might help him hang on to his broomstick later, but everybody else was very pleased when Hermione's lecture was interrupted by the arrival of the mail. 
2613 
2614 Harry hadn't had a single letter since Hagrid's note, something that Malfoy had been quick to notice, of course. Malfoy's eagle owl was always bringing him packages of sweets from home, which he opened gloatingly at the Slytherin table. 
2615 
2616 A barn owl brought Neville a small package from his grandmother. He opened it excitedly and showed them a glass ball the size of a large marble, which seemed to be full of white smoke. 
2617 
2618 "It's a Remembrall!" he explained. "Gran knows I forget things -- this tells you if there's something you've forgotten to do. Look, you hold it tight like this and if it turns red -- oh..." His face fell, because the Remembrall had suddenly glowed scarlet, "You've forgotten something..." 
2619 
2620 Neville was trying to remember what he'd forgotten when Draco Malfoy, who was passing the Gryffindor table, snatched the Remembrall out of his hand. 
2621 
2622 Harry and Ron jumped to their feet. They were half hoping for a reason to fight Malfay, but Professor McGonagall, who could spot trouble quicker than any teacher in the school, was there in a flash. 
2623 
2624 "What's going on?" 
2625 
2626 "Malfoy's got my Remembrall, Professor." 
2627 
2628 Scowling, Malfoy quickly dropped the Remembrall back on the table. 
2629 
2630 "Just looking," he said, and he sloped away with Crabbe and Goyle behind him. 
2631 
2632 At three-thirty that afternoon, Harry, Ron, and the other Gryffindors hurried down the front steps onto the grounds for their first flying lesson. It was a clear, breezy day, and the grass rippled under their feet as they marched down the sloping lawns toward a smooth, flat lawn on the opposite side of the grounds to the forbidden forest, whose trees were swaying darkly in the distance. 
2633 
2634 The Slytherins were already there, and so were twenty broomsticks lying in neat lines on the ground. Harry had heard Fred and George Weasley complain about the school brooms, saying that some of them started to vibrate if you flew too high, or always flew slightly to the left. 
2635 
2636 Their teacher, Madam Hooch, arrived. She had short, gray hair, and yellow eyes like a hawk. 
2637 
2638 "Well, what are you all waiting for?" she barked. "Everyone stand by a broomstick. Come on, hurry up." 
2639 
2640 Harry glanced down at his broom. It was old and some of the twigs stuck out at odd angles. 
2641 
2642 "Stick out your right hand over your broom," called Madam Hooch at the front, "and say 'Up!"' "UPF everyone shouted. 
2643 
2644 Harry's broom jumped into his hand at once, but it was one of the few that did. Hermione Granger's had simply rolled over on the ground, and Neville's hadn't moved at all. Perhaps brooms, like horses, could tell when you were afraid, thought Harry; there was a quaver in Neville's voice that said only too clearly that he wanted to keep his feet on the ground. 
2645 
2646 Madam Hooch then showed them how to mount their brooms without sliding off the end, and walked up and down the rows correcting their grips. 
2647 
2648 Harry and Ron were delighted when she told Malfoy he'd been doing it wrong for years. 
2649 
2650 "Now, when I blow my whistle, you kick off from the ground, hard," said Madam Hooch. "Keep your brooms steady, rise a few feet, and then come straight back down by leaning forward slightly. On my whistle -- three -- two --" 
2651 
2652 But Neville, nervous and jumpy and frightened of being left on the ground, pushed off hard before the whistle had touched Madam Hooch's lips. 
2653 
2654 "Come back, boy!" she shouted, but Neville was rising straight up like a cork shot out of a bottle -- twelve feet -- twenty feet. Harry saw his scared white face look down at the ground falling away, saw him gasp, slip sideways off the broom and -- WHAM -- a thud and a nasty crack and Neville lay facedown on the grass in a heap. His broomstick was still rising higher and higher, and started to drift lazily toward the forbidden forest and out of sight. 
2655 
2656 Madam Hooch was bending over Neville, her face as white as his. 
2657 
2658 "Broken wrist," Harry heard her mutter. "Come on, boy -- it's all right, up you get.". 
2659 
2660 She turned to the rest of the class. 
2661 
2662 "None of you is to move while I take this boy to the hospital wing! You leave those brooms where they are or you'll be out of Hogwarts before you can say 'Quidditch.' Come on, dear." 
2663 
2664 Neville, his face tear-streaked, clutching his wrist, hobbled off with Madam Hooch, who had her arm around him. 
2665 
2666 No sooner were they out of earshot than Malfoy burst into laughter. 
2667 
2668 "Did you see his face, the great lump?" 
2669 
2670 The other Slytherins joined in. 
2671 
2672 "Shut up, Malfoy," snapped Parvati Patil. 
2673 
2674 "Ooh, sticking up for Longbottom?" said Pansy Parkinson, a hard-faced Slytherin girl. "Never thought you'd like fat little crybabies, Parvati." 
2675 
2676 "Look!" said Malfoy, darting forward and snatching something out of the grass. "It's that stupid thing Longbottom's gran sent him." 
2677 
2678 The Remembrall glittered in the sun as he held it up. 
2679 
2680 "Give that here, Malfoy," said Harry quietly. Everyone stopped talking to watch. 
2681 
2682 Malfoy smiled nastily. 
2683 
2684 "I think I'll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find -- how about -- up a tree?" 
2685 
2686 "Give it here!" Harry yelled, but Malfoy had leapt onto his broomstick and taken off. He hadn't been lying, he could fly well. Hovering level with the topmost branches of an oak he called, "Come and get it, Potter!" 
2687 
2688 Harry grabbed his broom. 
2689 
2690 "No!" shouted Hermione Granger. "Madam Hooch told us not to move -- you'll get us all into trouble." 
2691 
2692 Harry ignored her. Blood was pounding in his ears. He mounted the broom and kicked hard against the ground and up, up he soared; air rushed through his hair, and his robes whipped out behind him -and in a rush of fierce joy he realized he'd found something he could do without being taught -- this was easy, this was wonderful. He pulled his broomstick up a little to take it even higher, and heard screams and gasps of girls back on the ground and an admiring whoop from Ron. 
2693 
2694 He turned his broomstick sharply to face Malfoy in midair. Malfoy looked stunned. 
2695 
2696 "Give it here," Harry called, "or I'll knock you off that broom!" "Oh, yeah?" said Malfoy, trying to sneer, but looking worried. 
2697 
2698 Harry knew, somehow, what to do. He leaned forward and grasped the broom tightly in both hands, and it shot toward Malfay like a javelin. Malfoy only just got out of the way in time; Harry made a sharp about-face and held the broom steady. A few people below were clapping. 
2699 
2700 "No Crabbe and Goyle up here to save your neck, Malfoy," Harry called. 
2701 
2702 The same thought seemed to have struck Malfoy. 
2703 
2704 "Catch it if you can, then!" he shouted, and he threw the glass ball high into the air and streaked back toward the ground. 
2705 
2706 Harry saw, as though in slow motion, the ball rise up in the air and then start to fall. He leaned forward and pointed his broom handle down -- next second he was gathering speed in a steep dive, racing the ball -- wind whistled in his ears, mingled with the screams of people watching -- he stretched out his hand -- a foot from the ground he caught it, just in time to pull his broom straight, and he toppled gently onto the grass with the Remembrall clutched safely in his fist. 
2707 
2708 "HARRY POTTER!" 
2709 
2710 His heart sank faster than he'd just dived. Professor McGonagall was running toward them. He got to his feet, trembling. 
2711 
2712 "Never -- in all my time at Hogwarts --" 
2713 
2714 Professor McGonagall was almost speechless with shock, and her glasses flashed furiously, "-- how dare you -- might have broken your neck --" 
2715 
2716 "It wasn't his fault, Professor --" 
2717 
2718 "Be quiet, Miss Patil "But Malfoy --" 
2719 
2720 "That's enough, Mr. Weasley. Potter, follow me, now." 
2721 
2722 Harry caught sight of Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle's triumphant faces as he left, walking numbly in Professor McGonagall's wake as she strode toward the castle. He was going to be expelled, he just knew it. He wanted to say something to defend himself, but there seemed to be something wrong with his voice. Professor McGonagall was sweeping along without even looking at him; he had to jog to keep up. Now he'd done it. He hadn't even lasted two weeks. He'd be packing his bags in ten minutes. What would the Dursleys say when he turned up on the doorstep? Up the front steps, up the marble staircase inside, and still Professor McGonagall didn't say a word to him. She wrenched open doors and marched along corridors with Harry trotting miserably behind her. Maybe she was taking him to Dumbledore. He thought of Hagrid, expelled but allowed to stay on as gamekeeper. Perhaps he could be Hagrid's assistant. His stomach twisted as he imagined it, watching Ron and the others becoming wizards, while he stumped around the grounds carrying Hagrid's bag. 
2723 
2724 Professor McGonagall stopped outside a classroom. She opened the door and poked her head inside. 
2725 
2726 "Excuse me, Professor Flitwick, could I borrow Wood for a moment?" 
2727 
2728 Wood? thought Harry, bewildered; was Wood a cane she was going to use on him? But Wood turned out to be a person, a burly fifth-year boy who came out of Flitwicles class looking confused. 
2729 
2730 "Follow me, you two," said Professor McGonagall, and they marched on up the corridor, Wood looking curiously at Harry. 
2731 
2732 "In here." 
2733 
2734 Professor McGonagall pointed them into a classroom that was empty except for Peeves, who was busy writing rude words on the blackboard. 
2735 
2736 "Out, Peeves!" she barked. Peeves threw the chalk into a bin, which clanged loudly, and he swooped out cursing. Professor McGonagall slammed the door behind him and turned to face the two boys. 
2737 
2738 "Potter, this is Oliver Wood. Wood -- I've found you a Seeker." 
2739 
2740 Wood's expression changed from puzzlement to delight. 
2741 
2742 "Are you serious, Professor?" 
2743 
2744 "Absolutely," said Professor McGonagall crisply. "The boy's a natural. 
2745 
2746 I've never seen anything like it. Was that your first time on a broomstick, Potter?" 
2747 
2748 Harry nodded silently. He didn't have a clue what was going on, but he didn't seem to be being expelled, and some of the feeling started coming back to his legs. 
2749 
2750 "He caught that thing in his hand after a fifty-foot dive," Professor McGonagall told Wood. "Didn't even scratch himself. Charlie Weasley couldn't have done it." 
2751 
2752 Wood was now looking as though all his dreams had come true at once. 
2753 
2754 "Ever seen a game of Quidditch, Potter?" he asked excitedly. 
2755 
2756 "Wood's captain of the Gryffindor team," Professor McGonagall explained. 
2757 
2758 "He's just the build for a Seeker, too," said Wood, now walking around Harry and staring at him. "Light -- speedy -- we'll have to get him a decent broom, Professor -- a Nimbus Two Thousand or a Cleansweep Seven, I'd say." 
2759 
2760 I shall speak to Professor Dumbledore and see if we can't bend the first-year rule. Heaven knows, we need a better team than last year. 
2761 
2762 Flattened in that last match by Slytherin, I couldn't look Severus Snape in the face for weeks...." 
2763 
2764 Professor McGonagall peered sternly over her glasses at Harry. 
2765 
2766 "I want to hear you're training hard, Potter, or I may change my mind about punishing you." 
2767 
2768 Then she suddenly smiled. 
2769 
2770 "Your father would have been proud," she said. "He was an excellent Quidditch player himself." 
2771 
2772 "You're joking." 
2773 
2774 It was dinnertime. Harry had just finished telling Ron what had happened when he'd left the grounds with Professor McGonagall. Ron had a piece of steak and kidney pie halfway to his mouth, but he'd forgotten all about it. 
2775 
2776 "Seeker?" he said. "But first years never -- you must be the youngest house player in about a century, said Harry, shoveling pie into his mouth. He felt particularly hungry after the excitement of the afternoon. "Wood told me." 
2777 
2778 Ron was so amazed, so impressed, he just sat and gaped at Harry. 
2779 
2780 "I start training next week," said Harry. "Only don't tell anyone, Wood wants to keep it a secret." 
2781 
2782 Fred and George Weasley now came into the hall, spotted Harry, and hurried over. 
2783 
2784 "Well done," said George in a low voice. "Wood told us. We're on the team too -- Beaters." 
2785 
2786 "I tell you, we're going to win that Quidditch cup for sure this year," 
2787 
2788 said Fred. "We haven't won since Charlie left, but this year's team is going to be brilliant. You must be good, Harry, Wood was almost skipping when he told us." 
2789 
2790 "Anyway, we've got to go, Lee Jordan reckons he's found a new secret passageway out of the school." 
2791 
2792 "Bet it's that one behind the statue of Gregory the Smarmy that we found in our first week. See you." 
2793 
2794 Fred and George had hardly disappeared when someone far less welcome turned up: Malfoy, flanked by Crabbe and Goyle. 
2795 
2796 "Having a last meal, Potter? When are you getting the train back to the Muggles?" 
2797 
2798 "You're a lot braver now that you're back on the ground and you've got your little friends with you," said Harry coolly. There was of course nothing at all little about Crabbe and Goyle, but as the High Table was full of teachers, neither of them could do more than crack their knuckles and scowl. 
2799 
2800 "I'd take you on anytime on my own," said Malfoy. "Tonight, if you want. 
2801 
2802 Wizard's duel. Wands only -- no contact. What's the matter? Never heard of a wizard's duel before, I suppose?" 
2803 
2804 "Of course he has," said Ron, wheeling around. "I'm his second, who's yours?" 
2805 
2806 Malfoy looked at Crabbe and Goyle, sizing them up. 
2807 
2808 "Crabbe," he said. "Midnight all right? We'll meet you in the trophy room; that's always unlocked." 
2809 
2810 When Malfoy had gone, Ron and Harry looked at each other. "What is a wizard's duel?" said Harry. "And what do you mean, you're my second?" 
2811 
2812 "Well, a second's there to take over if you die," said Ron casually, getting started at last on his cold pie. Catching the look on Harry's face, he added quickly, "But people only die in proper duels, you know, with real wizards. The most you and Malfoy'll be able to do is send sparks at each other. Neither of you knows enough magic to do any real damage. I bet he expected you to refuse, anyway." 
2813 
2814 "And what if I wave my wand and nothing happens?" 
2815 
2816 "Throw it away and punch him on the nose," Ron suggested. "Excuse me." 
2817 
2818 They both looked up. It was Hermione Granger. 
2819 
2820 "Can't a person eat in peace in this place?" said Ron. 
2821 
2822 Hermione ignored him and spoke to Harry. 
2823 
2824 "I couldn't help overhearing what you and Malfoy were saying --" 
2825 
2826 "Bet you could," Ron muttered. 
2827 
2828 "--and you mustn't go wandering around the school at night, think of the points you'll lose Gryffindor if you're caught, and you're bound to be. 
2829 
2830 It's really very selfish of you." 
2831 
2832 "And it's really none of your business," said Harry. 
2833 
2834 "Good-bye," said Ron. 
2835 
2836 All the same, it wasn't what you'd call the perfect end to the day, Harry thought, as he lay awake much later listening to Dean and Seamus falling asleep (Neville wasn't back from the hospital wing). Ron had spent all evening giving him advice such as "If he tries to curse you, you'd better dodge it, because I can't remember how to block them." 
2837 
2838 There was a very good chance they were going to get caught by Filch or Mrs. Norris, and Harry felt he was pushing his luck, breaking another school rule today. On the other hand, Malfoys sneering face kept looming up out of the darkness - this was his big chance to beat Malfoy face-to-face. He couldn't miss it. 
2839 
2840 "Half-past eleven," Ron muttered at last, "we'd better go." 
2841 
2842 They pulled on their bathrobes, picked up their wands, and crept across the tower room, down the spiral staircase, and into the Gryffindor common room. A few embers were still glowing in the fireplace, turning all the armchairs into hunched black shadows. They had almost reached the portrait hole when a voice spoke from the chair nearest them, "I can't believe you're going to do this, Harry." 
2843 
2844 A lamp flickered on. It was Hermione Granger, wearing a pink bathrobe and a frown. 
2845 
2846 "You!" said Ron furiously. "Go back to bed!" 
2847 
2848 "I almost told your brother," Hermione snapped, "Percy -- he's a prefect, he'd put a stop to this." 
2849 
2850 Harry couldn't believe anyone could be so interfering. 
2851 
2852 "Come on," he said to Ron. He pushed open the portrait of the Fat Lady and climbed through the hole. 
2853 
2854 Hermione wasn't going to give up that easily. She followed Ron through the portrait hole, hissing at them like an angry goose. 
2855 
2856 "Don't you care about Gryffindor, do you only care about yourselves, I don't want Slytherin to win the house cup, and you'll lose all the points I got from Professor McGonagall for knowing about Switching Spells." 
2857 
2858 "Go away." "All right, but I warned you, you just remember what I said when you're on the train home tomorrow, you're so --" 
2859 
2860 But what they were, they didn't find out. Hermione had turned to the portrait of the Fat Lady to get back inside and found herself facing an empty painting. The Fat Lady had gone on a nighttime visit and Hermione was locked out of Gryffindor tower. 
2861 
2862 "Now what am I going to do?" she asked shrilly. 
2863 
2864 "That's your problem," said Ron. "We've got to go, we 3 re going to be late." 
2865 
2866 They hadn't even reached the end of the corridor when Hermione caught up with them. 
2867 
2868 "I'm coming with you," she said. 
2869 
2870 "You are not." 
2871 
2872 "D'you think I'm going to stand out here and wait for Filch to catch me? If he finds all three of us I'll tell him the truth, that I was trying to stop you, and you can back me up." 
2873 
2874 "You've got some nerve --" said Ron loudly. 
2875 
2876 "Shut up, both of you!" said Harry sharply. I heard something." 
2877 
2878 It was a sort of snuffling. 
2879 
2880 "Mrs. Norris?" breathed Ron, squinting through the dark. 
2881 
2882 It wasn't Mrs. Norris. It was Neville. He was curled up on the floor, fast asleep, but jerked suddenly awake as they crept nearer. 
2883 
2884 "Thank goodness you found me! I've been out here for hours, I couldn't remember the new password to get in to bed." 
2885 
2886 "Keep your voice down, Neville. The password's 'Pig snout' but it won't help you now, the Fat Lady's gone off somewhere." 
2887 
2888 "How's your arm?" said Harry. 
2889 
2890 "Fine," said Neville, showing them. "Madam Pomfrey mended it in about a minute." 
2891 
2892 "Good - well, look, Neville, we've got to be somewhere, we'll see you later --" 
2893 
2894 "Don't leave me!" said Neville, scrambling to his feet, "I don't want to stay here alone, the Bloody Baron's been past twice already." 
2895 
2896 Ron looked at his watch and then glared furiously at Hermione and Neville. 
2897 
2898 "If either of you get us caught, I'll never rest until I've learned that Curse of the Bogies Quirrell told us about, and used it on you. 
2899 
2900 Hermione opened her mouth, perhaps to tell Ron exactly how to use the Curse of the Bogies, but Harry hissed at her to be quiet and beckoned them all forward. 
2901 
2902 They flitted along corridors striped with bars of moonlight from the high windows. At every turn Harry expected to run into Filch or Mrs. Norris, but they were lucky. They sped up a staircase to the third floor and tiptoed toward the trophy room. 
2903 
2904 Malfoy and Crabbe weren't there yet. The crystal trophy cases glimmered where the moonlight caught them. Cups, shields, plates, and statues winked silver and gold in the darkness. They edged along the walls, keeping their eyes on the doors at either end of the room. Harry took out his wand in case Malfoy leapt in and started at once. The minutes crept by. 
2905 
2906 "He's late, maybe he's chickened out," Ron whispered. 
2907 
2908 Then a noise in the next room made them jump. Harry had only just raised his wand when they heard someone speak -and it wasn't Malfoy. 
2909 
2910 "Sniff around, my sweet, they might be lurking in a corner." 
2911 
2912 It was Filch speaking to Mrs. Norris. Horror-struck, Harry waved madly at the other three to follow him as quickly as possible; they scurried silently toward the door, away from Filch's voice. Neville's robes had barely whipped round the corner when they heard Filch enter the trophy room. 
2913 
2914 "They're in here somewhere," they heard him mutter, "probably hiding." 
2915 
2916 "This way!" Harry mouthed to the others and, petrified, they began to creep down a long gallery full of suits of armor. They could hear Filch getting nearer. Neville suddenly let out a frightened squeak and broke into a run -he tripped, grabbed Ron around the waist, and the pair of them toppled right into a suit of armor. 
2917 
2918 The clanging and crashing were enough to wake the whole castle. 
2919 
2920 "RUN!" Harry yelled, and the four of them sprinted down the gallery, not looking back to see whether Filch was following -- they swung around the doorpost and galloped down one corridor then another, Harry in the lead, without any idea where they were or where they were going -- they ripped through a tapestry and found themselves in a hidden passageway, hurtled along it and came out near their Charms classroom, which they knew was miles from the trophy room. 
2921 
2922 "I think we've lost him," Harry panted, leaning against the cold wall and wiping his forehead. Neville was bent double, wheezing and spluttering. 
2923 
2924 I -- told -you," Hermione gasped, clutching at the stitch in her chest, "I -- told -- you." 
2925 
2926 "We've got to get back to Gryffindor tower," said Ron, "quickly as possible." 
2927 
2928 "Malfoy tricked you," Hermione said to Harry. "You realize that, don't you? He was never going to meet you -- Filch knew someone was going to be in the trophy room, Malfoy must have tipped him off." 
2929 
2930 Harry thought she was probably right, but he wasn't going to tell her that. 
2931 
2932 "Let's go." 
2933 
2934 It wasn't going to be that simple. They hadn't gone more than a dozen paces when a doorknob rattled and something came shooting out of a classroom in front of them. 
2935 
2936 It was Peeves. He caught sight of them and gave a squeal of delight. 
2937 
2938 "Shut up, Peeves -- please -- you'll get us thrown out." 
2939 
2940 Peeves cackled. 
2941 
2942 "Wandering around at midnight, Ickle Firsties? Tut, tut, tut. Naughty, naughty, you'll get caughty." 
2943 
2944 "Not if you don't give us away, Peeves, please." 
2945 
2946 "Should tell Filch, I should," said Peeves in a saintly voice, but his eyes glittered wickedly. "It's for your own good, you know." 
2947 
2948 "Get out of the way," snapped Ron, taking a swipe at Peeves this was a big mistake. 
2949 
2950 "STUDENTS OUT OF BED!" Peeves bellowed, "STUDENTS OUT OF BED DOWN THE CHARMS CORRIDOR" 
2951 
2952 Ducking under Peeves, they ran for their lives, right to the end of the corridor where they slammed into a door -- and it was locked. 
2953 
2954 "This is it!" Ron moaned, as they pushed helplessly at the door, "We're done for! This is the end!" They could hear footsteps, Filch running as fast as he could toward Peeves's shouts. 
2955 
2956 "Oh, move over," Hermione snarled. She grabbed Harry's wand, tapped the lock, and whispered, 'Alohomora!" 
2957 
2958 The lock clicked and the door swung open -- they piled through it, shut it quickly, and pressed their ears against it, listening. 
2959 
2960 "Which way did they go, Peeves?" Filch was saying. "Quick, tell me." 
2961 
2962 "Say 'please."' "Don't mess with me, Peeves, now where did they go?" 
2963 
2964 "Shan't say nothing if you don't say please," said Peeves in his annoying singsong voice. 
2965 
2966 "All right -please." 
2967 
2968 "NOTHING! Ha haaa! Told you I wouldn't say nothing if you didn't say please! Ha ha! Haaaaaa!" And they heard the sound of Peeves whooshing away and Filch cursing in rage. 
2969 
2970 "He thinks this door is locked," Harry whispered. "I think we'll be okay -- get off, Neville!" For Neville had been tugging on the sleeve of Harry's bathrobe for the last minute. "What?" 
2971 
2972 Harry turned around -- and saw, quite clearly, what. For a moment, he was sure he'd walked into a nightmare -- this was too much, on top of everything that had happened so far. 
2973 
2974 They weren't in a room, as he had supposed. They were in a corridor. The forbidden corridor on the third floor. And now they knew why it was forbidden. 
2975 
2976 They were looking straight into the eyes of a monstrous dog, a dog that filled the whole space between ceiling and floor. It had three heads. 
2977 
2978 Three pairs of rolling, mad eyes; three noses, twitching and quivering in their direction; three drooling mouths, saliva hanging in slippery ropes from yellowish fangs. 
2979 
2980 It was standing quite still, all six eyes staring at them, and Harry knew that the only reason they weren't already dead was that their sudden appearance had taken it by surprise, but it was quickly getting over that, there was no mistaking what those thunderous growls meant. 
2981 
2982 Harry groped for the doorknob -- between Filch and death, he'd take Filch. 
2983 
2984 They fell backward -- Harry slammed the door shut, and they ran, they almost flew, back down the corridor. Filch must have hurried off to look for them somewhere else, because they didn't see him anywhere, but they hardly cared -- all they wanted to do was put as much space as possible between them and that monster. They didn't stop running until they reached the portrait of the Fat Lady on the seventh floor. 
2985 
2986 "Where on earth have you all been?" she asked, looking at their bathrobes hanging off their shoulders and their flushed, sweaty faces. 
2987 
2988 "Never mind that -- pig snout, pig snout," panted Harry, and the portrait swung forward. They scrambled into the common room and collapsed, trembling, into armchairs. 
2989 
2990 It was a while before any of them said anything. Neville, indeed, looked as if he'd never speak again. 
2991 
2992 "What do they think they're doing, keeping a thing like that locked up in a school?" said Ron finally. "If any dog needs exercise, that one does." 
2993 
2994 Hermione had got both her breath and her bad temper back again. "You don't use your eyes, any of you, do you?" she snapped. "Didn't you see what it was standing on. 
2995 
2996 "The floor?" Harry suggested. "I wasn't looking at its feet, I was too busy with its heads." 
2997 
2998 "No, not the floor. It was standing on a trapdoor. It's obviously guarding something." 
2999 
3000 She stood up, glaring at them. 
3001 
3002 I hope you're pleased with yourselves. We could all have been killed -- or worse, expelled. Now, if you don't mind, I'm going to bed." 
3003 
3004 Ron stared after her, his mouth open. 
3005 
3006 "No, we don't mind," he said. "You'd think we dragged her along, wouldn't you. 
3007 
3008 But Hermione had given Harry something else to think about as he climbed back into bed. The dog was guarding something.... What had Hagrid said? Gringotts was the safest place in the world for something you wanted to hide -- except perhaps Hogwarts. 
3009 
3010 It looked as though Harry had found out where the grubby littie package from vault seven hundred and thirteen was. 
3011 
3012 CHAPTER TEN 
3013 
3014 HALLOWEEN 
3015 
3016 Malfoy couldn't believe his eyes when he saw that Harry and Ron were still at Hogwarts the next day, looking tired but perfectly cheerful. 
3017 
3018 Indeed, by the next morning Harry and Ron thought that meeting the three-headed dog had been an excellent adventure, and they were quite keen to have another one. In the meantime, Harry filled Ron in about the package that seemed to have been moved from Gringotts to Hogwarts, and they spent a lot of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy protection. "It's either really valuable or really dangerous," said Ron. 
3019 
3020 "Or both," said Harry. 
3021 
3022 But as all they knew for sure about the mysterious object was that it was about two inches long, they didn't have much chance of guessing what it was without further clues. 
3023 
3024 Neither Neville nor Hermione showed the slightest interest in what lay underneath the dog and the trapdoor. All Neville cared about was never going near the dog again. 
3025 
3026 Hermione was now refusing to speak to Harry and Ron, but she was such a bossy know-it-all that they saw this as an added bonus. All they really wanted now was a way of getting back at Malfoy, and to their great delight, just such a thing arrived in the mail about a week later. 
3027 
3028 As the owls flooded into the Great Hall as usual, everyone's attention was caught at once by a long, thin package carried by six large screech owls. Harry was just as interested as everyone else to see what was in this large parcel, and was amazed when the owls soared down and dropped it right in front of him, knocking his bacon to the floor. They had hardly fluttered out of the way when another owl dropped a letter on top of the parcel. 
3029 
3030 Harry ripped open the letter first, which was lucky, because it said: DO NOT OPEN THE PARCEL AT THE TABLE. 
3031 
3032 It contains your new Nimbus Two Thousand, but I don't want everybody knowing you've got a broomstick or they'll all want one. Oliver Wood will meet you tonight on the Quidditch field at seven o'clock for your first training session. 
3033 
3034 Professor McGonagall Harry had difficulty hiding his glee as he handed the note to Ron to read. 
3035 
3036 "A Nimbus Two Thousand!" Ron moaned enviously. "I've never even touched one." 
3037 
3038 They left the hall quickly, wanting to unwrap the broomstick in private before their first class, but halfway across the entrance hall they found the way upstairs barred by Crabbe and Goyle. Malfoy seized the package from Harry and felt it. 
3039 
3040 "That's a broomstick," he said, throwing it back to Harry with a mixture of jealousy and spite on his face. "You'll be in for it this time, Potter, first years aren't allowed them." 
3041 
3042 Ron couldn't resist it. 
3043 
3044 "It's not any old broomstick," he said, "it's a Nimbus Two Thousand. 
3045 
3046 What did you say you've got at home, Malfoy, a Comet Two Sixty?" Ron grinned at Harry. "Comets look flashy, but they're not in the same league as the Nimbus." 
3047 
3048 "What would you know about it, Weasley, you couldn't afford half the handle," Malfoy snapped back. "I suppose you and your brothers have to save up twig by twig." 
3049 
3050 Before Ron could answer, Professor Flitwick appeared at Malfoy's elbow. 
3051 
3052 "Not arguing, I hope, boys?" he squeaked. 
3053 
3054 "Potter's been sent a broomstick, Professor," said Malfoy quickly. 
3055 
3056 "Yes, yes, that's right," said Professor Flitwick, beaming at Harry. 
3057 
3058 "Professor McGonagall told me all about the special circumstances, Potter. And what model is it?" 
3059 
3060 "A Nimbus Two Thousand, sit," said Harry, fighting not to laugh at the look of horror on Malfoy's face. "And it's really thanks to Malfoy here that I've got it," he added. 
3061 
3062 Harry and Ron headed upstairs, smothering their laughter at Malfoy's obvious rage and confusion. "Well, it's true," Harry chortled as they reached the top of the marble staircase, "If he hadn't stolen Neville's Remembrall I wouln't be on the team...." 
3063 
3064 "So I suppose you think that's a reward for breaking rules?" came an angry voice from just behind them. Hermione was stomping up the stairs, looking disapprovingly at the package in Harry's hand. 
3065 
3066 "I thought you weren't speaking to us?" said Harry. 
3067 
3068 "Yes, don't stop now," said Ron, "it's doing us so much good." 
3069 
3070 Hermione marched away with her nose in the air. 
3071 
3072 Harry had a lot of trouble keeping his mind on his lessons that day. It kept wandering up to the dormitory where his new broomstick was lying under his bed, or straying off to the Quidditch field where he'd be learning to play that night. He bolted his dinner that evening without noticing what he was eating, and then rushed upstairs with Ron to unwrap the Nimbus Two Thousand at last. 
3073 
3074 "Wow," Ron sighed, as the broomstick rolled onto Harry's bedspread. 
3075 
3076 Even Harry, who knew nothing about the different brooms, thought it looked wonderful. Sleek and shiny, with a mahogany handle, it had a long tail of neat, straight twigs and Nimbus Two Thousand written in gold near the top. 
3077 
3078 As seven o'clock drew nearer, Harry left the castle and set off in the dusk toward the Quidditch field. Held never been inside the stadium before. Hundreds of seats were raised in stands around the field so that the spectators were high enough to see what was going on. At either end of the field were three golden poles with hoops on the end. They reminded Harry of the little plastic sticks Muggle children blew bubbles through, except that they were fifty feet high. 
3079 
3080 Too eager to fly again to wait for Wood, Harry mounted his broomstick and kicked off from the ground. What a feeling -- he swooped in and out of the goal posts and then sped up and down the field. The Nimbus Two Thousand turned wherever he wanted at his lightest touch. 
3081 
3082 "Hey, Potter, come down!' Oliver Wood had arrived. fie was carrying a large wooden crate under his arm. Harry landed next to him. 
3083 
3084 "Very nice," said Wood, his eyes glinting. "I see what McGonagall meant... you really are a natural. I'm just going to teach you the rules this evening, then you'll be joining team practice three times a week." 
3085 
3086 He opened the crate. Inside were four different-sized balls. 
3087 
3088 "Right," said Wood. "Now, Quidditch is easy enough to understand, even if it's not too easy to play. There are seven players on each side. 
3089 
3090 Three of them are called Chasers." 
3091 
3092 "Three Chasers," Harry repeated, as Wood took out a bright red ball about the size of a soccer ball. 
3093 
3094 "This ball's called the Quaffle," said Wood. "The Chasers throw the Quaffle to each other and try and get it through one of the hoops to score a goal. Ten points every time the Quaffle goes through one of the hoops. Follow me?" 
3095 
3096 "The Chasers throw the Quaffle and put it through the hoops to score," 
3097 
3098 Harry recited. "So -- that's sort of like basketball on broomsticks with six hoops, isn't it?" 
3099 
3100 "What's basketball?" said Wood curiously. "Never mind," said Harry quickly. 
3101 
3102 "Now, there's another player on each side who's called the Keeper -I'm Keeper for Gryffindor. I have to fly around our hoops and stop the other team from scoring." 
3103 
3104 "Three Chasers, one Keeper," said Harry, who was determined to remember it all. "And they play with the Quaffle. Okay, got that. So what are they for?" He pointed at the three balls left inside the box. 
3105 
3106 "I'll show you now," said Wood. "Take this." 
3107 
3108 He handed Harry a small club, a bit like a short baseball bat. 
3109 
3110 "I'm going to show you what the Bludgers do," Wood said. "These two are the Bludgers." 
3111 
3112 He showed Harry two identical balls, jet black and slightly smaller than the red Quaffle. Harry noticed that they seemed to be straining to escape the straps holding them inside the box. 
3113 
3114 "Stand back," Wood warned Harry. He bent down and freed one of the Bludgers. 
3115 
3116 At once, the black ball rose high in the air and then pelted straight at Harry's face. Harry swung at it with the bat to stop it from breaking his nose, and sent it zigzagging away into the air -- it zoomed around their heads and then shot at Wood, who dived on top of it and managed to pin it to the ground. 
3117 
3118 "See?" Wood panted, forcing the struggling Bludger back into the crate and strapping it down safely. "The Bludgers rocket around, trying to knock players off their brooms. That's why you have two Beaters on each team -- the Weasley twins are ours -- it's their job to protect their side from the Bludgers and try and knock them toward the other team. So -- think you've got all that?" 
3119 
3120 "Three Chasers try and score with the Quaffle; the Keeper guards the goal posts; the Beaters keep the Bludgers away from their team," Harry reeled off. 
3121 
3122 "Very good," said Wood. 
3123 
3124 "Er -- have the Bludgers ever killed anyone?" Harry asked, hoping he sounded offhand. 
3125 
3126 "Never at Hogwarts. We've had a couple of broken jaws but nothing worse than that. Now, the last member of the team is the Seeker. That's you. And you don't have to worry about the Quaffle or the Bludgers unless they crack my head open." 
3127 
3128 "Don't worry, the Weasleys are more than a match for the Bludgers -- I mean, they're like a pair of human Bludgers themselves." 
3129 
3130 Wood reached into the crate and took out the fourth and last ball. 
3131 
3132 Compared with the Quaffle and the Bludgers, it was tiny, about the size of a large walnut. It was bright gold and had little fluttering silver wings. 
3133 
3134 "This," said Wood, "is the Golden Snitch, and it's the most important ball of the lot. It's very hard to catch because it's so fast and difficult to see. It's the Seeker's job to catch it. You've got to weave in and out of the Chasers, Beaters, Bludgers, and Quaffle to get it before the other team's Seeker, because whichever Seeker catches the Snitch wins his team an extra hundred and fifty points, so they nearly always win. That's why Seekers get fouled so much. A game of Quidditch only ends when the Snitch is caught, so it can go on for ages -- I think the record is three months, they had to keep bringing on substitutes so the players could get some sleep. "Well, that's it -- any questions?" 
3135 
3136 Harry shook his head. He understood what he had to do all right, it was doing it that was going to be the problem. 
3137 
3138 "We won't practice with the Snitch yet," said Wood, carefully shutting it back inside the crate, "it's too dark, we might lose it. Let's try you out with a few of these." 
3139 
3140 He pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of his pocket and a few minutes later, he and Harry were up in the air, Wood throwing the golf balls as hard as he could in every direction for Harry to catch. 
3141 
3142 Harry didn't miss a single one, and Wood was delighted. After half an hour, night had really fallen and they couldn't carry on. 
3143 
3144 "That Quidditch cup'll have our name on it this year," said Wood happily as they trudged back up to the castle. "I wouldn't be surprised if you turn out better than Charlie Weasley, and he could have played for England if he hadn't gone off chasing dragons." 
3145 
3146 Perhaps it was because he was now so busy, what with Quidditch practice three evenings a week on top of all his homework, but Harry could hardly believe it when he realized that he'd already been at Hogwarts two months. The castle felt more like home than Privet Drive ever had. His lessons, too, were becoming more and more interesting now that they had mastered the basics. 
3147 
3148 On Halloween morning they woke to the delicious smell of baking pumpkin wafting through the corridors. Even better, Professor Flitwick announced in Charms that he thought they were ready to start making objects fly, something they had all been dying to try since they'd seen him make Neville's toad zoom around the classroom. Professor Flitwick put the class into pairs to practice. Harry's partner was Seamus Finnigan (which was a relief, because Neville had been trying to catch his eye). Ron, however, was to be working with Hermione Granger. It was hard to tell whether Ron or Hermione was angrier about this. She hadn't spoken to either of them since the day Harry's broomstick had arrived. 
3149 
3150 "Now, don't forget that nice wrist movement we've been practicing!" 
3151 
3152 squeaked Professor Flitwick, perched on top of his pile of books as usual. "Swish and flick, remember, swish and flick. And saying the magic words properly is very important, too -- never forget Wizard Baruffio, who said 's' instead of 'f' and found himself on the floor with a buffalo on his chest." 
3153 
3154 It was very difficult. Harry and Seamus swished and flicked, but the feather they were supposed to be sending skyward just lay on the desktop. Seamus got so impatient that he prodded it with his wand and set fire to it -- Harry had to put it out with his hat. 
3155 
3156 Ron, at the next table, wasn't having much more luck. 
3157 
3158 "Wingardium Leviosa!" he shouted, waving his long arms like a windmill. 
3159 
3160 "You're saying it wrong," Harry heard Hermione snap. "It's Wing-gar-dium Levi-o-sa, make the 'gar' nice and long." 
3161 
3162 "You do it, then, if you're so clever," Ron snarled. 
3163 
3164 Hermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown, flicked her wand, and said, "Wingardium Leviosa!" 
3165 
3166 Their feather rose off the desk and hovered about four feet above their heads. 
3167 
3168 "Oh, well done!" cried Professor Flitwick, clapping. "Everyone see here, Miss Granger's done it!" 
3169 
3170 Ron was in a very bad mood by the end of the class. "It's no wonder no one can stand her," he said to Harry as they pushed their way into the crowded corridor, "she's a nightmare, honestly. � 
3171 
3172 Someone knocked into Harry as they hurried past him. It was Hermione. 
3173 
3174 Harry caught a glimpse of her face -- and was startled to see that she was in tears. 
3175 
3176 "I think she heard you." 
3177 
3178 "So?" said Ron, but he looked a bit uncomfortable. "She must've noticed she's got no friends." 
3179 
3180 Hermione didn't turn up for the next class and wasn't seen all afternoon. On their way down to the Great Hall for the Halloween feast, Harry and Ron overheard Parvati Patil telling her friend Lavender that Hermione was crying in the girls' bathroom and wanted to be left alone. 
3181 
3182 Ron looked still more awkward at this, but a moment later they had entered the Great Hall, where the Halloween decorations put Hermione out of their minds. 
3183 
3184 A thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and ceiling while a thousand more swooped over the tables in low black clouds, making the candles in the pumpkins stutter. The feast appeared suddenly on the golden plates, as it had at the start-of-term banquet. 
3185 
3186 Harry was just helping himself to a baked potato when Professor Quirrell came sprinting into the hall, his turban askew and terror on his face. 
3187 
3188 Everyone stared as he reached Professor Dumbledore's chair, slumped against the table, and gasped, "Troll -- in the dungeons -- thought you ought to know." 
3189 
3190 He then sank to the floor in a dead faint. 
3191 
3192 There was an uproar. It took several purple firecrackers exploding from the end of Professor Dumbledore's wand to bring silence. 
3193 
3194 "Prefects," he rumbled, "lead your Houses back to the dormitories immediately!" 
3195 
3196 Percy was in his element. 
3197 
3198 "Follow me! Stick together, first years! No need to fear the troll if you follow my orders! Stay close behind me, now. Make way, first years coming through! Excuse me, I'm a prefect!" 
3199 
3200 "How could a troll get in?" Harry asked as they climbed the stairs. 
3201 
3202 "Don't ask me, they're supposed to be really stupid," said Ron. "Maybe Peeves let it in for a Halloween joke." 
3203 
3204 They passed different groups of people hurrying in different directions. 
3205 
3206 As they jostled their way through a crowd of confused Hufflepuffs, Harry suddenly grabbed Ron's arm. 
3207 
3208 "I've just thought -- Hermione." 
3209 
3210 "What about her?" 
3211 
3212 "She doesn't know about the troll." 
3213 
3214 Ron bit his lip. 
3215 
3216 "Oh, all right," he snapped. "But Percy'd better not see us." 
3217 
3218 Ducking down, they joined the Hufflepuffs going the other way, slipped down a deserted side corridor, and hurried off toward the girls' bathroom. They had just turned the corner when they heard quick footsteps behind them. 
3219 
3220 "Percy!" hissed Ron, pulling Harry behind a large stone griffin. 
3221 
3222 Peering around it, however, they saw not Percy but Snape. He crossed the corridor and disappeared from view. 
3223 
3224 "What's he doing?" Harry whispered. "Why isn't he down in the dungeons with the rest of the teachers?" 
3225 
3226 "Search me." 
3227 
3228 Quietly as possible, they crept along the next corridor after Snape's fading footsteps. 
3229 
3230 "He's heading for the third floor," Harry said, but Ron held up his hand. 
3231 
3232 "Can you smell something?" 
3233 
3234 Harry sniffed and a foul stench reached his nostrils, a mixture of old socks and the kind of public toilet no one seems to clean. 
3235 
3236 And then they heard it -- a low grunting, and the shuffling footfalls of gigantic feet. Ron pointed -- at the end of a passage to the left, something huge was moving toward them. They shrank into the shadows and watched as it emerged into a patch of moonlight. 
3237 
3238 It was a horrible sight. Twelve feet tall, its skin was a dull, granite gray, its great lumpy body like a boulder with its small bald head perched on top like a coconut. It had short legs thick as tree trunks with flat, horny feet. The smell coming from it was incredible. It was holding a huge wooden club, which dragged along the floor because its arms were so long. 
3239 
3240 The troll stopped next to a doorway and peered inside. It waggled its long ears, making up its tiny mind, then slouched slowly into the room. 
3241 
3242 "The keys in the lock," Harry muttered. "We could lock it in." 
3243 
3244 "Good idea," said Ron nervously. 
3245 
3246 They edged toward the open door, mouths dry, praying the troll wasn't about to come out of it. With one great leap, Harry managed to grab the key, slam the door, and lock it. 
3247 
3248 'Yes!" 
3249 
3250 Flushed with their victory, they started to run back up the passage, but as they reached the corner they heard something that made their hearts stop -- a high, petrified scream -- and it was coming from the chamber they'd just chained up. 
3251 
3252 "Oh, no," said Ron, pale as the Bloody Baron. 
3253 
3254 "It's the girls' bathroom!" Harry gasped. 
3255 
3256 "Hermione!" they said together. 
3257 
3258 It was the last thing they wanted to do, but what choice did they have? Wheeling around, they sprinted back to the door and turned the key, fumbling in their panic. Harry pulled the door open and they ran inside. 
3259 
3260 Hermione Granger was shrinking against the wall opposite, looking as if she was about to faint. The troll was advancing on her, knocking the sinks off the walls as it went. 
3261 
3262 "Confuse it!" Harry said desperately to Ron, and, seizing a tap, he threw it as hard as he could against the wall. 
3263 
3264 The troll stopped a few feet from Hermione. It lumbered around, blinking stupidly, to see what had made the noise. Its mean little eyes saw Harry. It hesitated, then made for him instead, lifting its club as it went. 
3265 
3266 "Oy, pea-brain!" yelled Ron from the other side of the chamber, and he threw a metal pipe at it. The troll didn't even seem to notice the pipe hitting its shoulder, but it heard the yell and paused again, turning its ugly snout toward Ron instead, giving Harry time to run around it. 
3267 
3268 "Come on, run, run!" Harry yelled at Hermione, trying to pull her toward the door, but she couldn't move, she was still flat against the wall, her mouth open with terror. 
3269 
3270 The shouting and the echoes seemed to be driving the troll berserk. It roared again and started toward Ron, who was nearest and had no way to escape. 
3271 
3272 Harry then did something that was both very brave and very stupid: He took a great running jump and managed to fasten his arms around the troll's neck from behind. The troll couldn't feel Harry hanging there, but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit of wood up its nose, and Harry's wand had still been in his hand when he'd jumped -- it had gone straight up one of the troll's nostrils. 
3273 
3274 Howling with pain, the troll twisted and flailed its club, with Harry clinging on for dear life; any second, the troll was going to rip him off or catch him a terrible blow with the club. 
3275 
3276 Hermione had sunk to the floor in fright; Ron pulled out his own wand -- not knowing what he was going to do he heard himself cry the first spell that came into his head: "Wingardium Leviosa!" 
3277 
3278 The club flew suddenly out of the troll's hand, rose high, high up into the air, turned slowly over -- and dropped, with a sickening crack, onto its owner's head. The troll swayed on the spot and then fell flat on its face, with a thud that made the whole room tremble. 
3279 
3280 Harry got to his feet. He was shaking and out of breath. Ron was standing there with his wand still raised, staring at what he had done. 
3281 
3282 It was Hermione who spoke first. 
3283 
3284 "Is it -- dead?" 
3285 
3286 I don't think so," said Harry, I think it's just been knocked out." 
3287 
3288 He bent down and pulled his wand out of the troll's nose. It was covered in what looked like lumpy gray glue. 
3289 
3290 "Urgh -- troll boogers." 
3291 
3292 He wiped it on the troll's trousers. 
3293 
3294 A sudden slamming and loud footsteps made the three of them look up. 
3295 
3296 They hadn't realized what a racket they had been making, but of course, someone downstairs must have heard the crashes and the troll's roars. A moment later, Professor McGonagall had come bursting into the room, closely followed by Snape, with Quirrell bringing up the rear. Quirrell took one look at the troll, let out a faint whimper, and sat quickly down on a toilet, clutching his heart. 
3297 
3298 Snape bent over the troll. Professor McGonagall was looking at Ron and Harry. Harry had never seen her look so angry. Her lips were white. 
3299 
3300 Hopes of winning fifty points for Gryffindor faded quickly from Harry's mind. 
3301 
3302 "What on earth were you thinking of?" said Professor McGonagall, with cold fury in her voice. Harry looked at Ron, who was still standing with his wand in the air. "You're lucky you weren't killed. Why aren't you in your dormitory?" 
3303 
3304 Snape gave Harry a swift, piercing look. Harry looked at the floor. He wished Ron would put his wand down. 
3305 
3306 Then a small voice came out of the shadows. 
3307 
3308 "Please, Professor McGonagall -- they were looking for me." 
3309 
3310 "Miss Granger!" 
3311 
3312 Hermione had managed to get to her feet at last. 
3313 
3314 I went looking for the troll because I -- I thought I could deal with it on my own -- you know, because I've read all about them." 
3315 
3316 Ron dropped his wand. Hermione Granger, telling a downright lie to a teacher? "If they hadn't found me, I'd be dead now. Harry stuck his wand up its nose and Ron knocked it out with its own club. They didn't have time to come and fetch anyone. It was about to finish me off when they arrived." 
3317 
3318 Harry and Ron tried to look as though this story wasn't new to them. 
3319 
3320 "Well -- in that case..." said Professor McGonagall, staring at the three of them, "Miss Granger, you foolish girl, how could you think of tackling a mountain troll on your own?" 
3321 
3322 Hermione hung her head. Harry was speechless. Hermione was the last person to do anything against the rules, and here she was, pretending she had, to get them out of trouble. It was as if Snape had started handing out sweets. 
3323 
3324 "Miss Granger, five points will be taken from Gryffindor for this," said Professor McGonagall. "I'm very disappointed in you. If you're not hurt at all, you'd better get off to Gryffindor tower. Students are finishing the feast in their houses." 
3325 
3326 Hermione left. 
3327 
3328 Professor McGonagall turned to Harry and Ron. 
3329 
3330 "Well, I still say you were lucky, but not many first years could have taken on a full-grown mountain troll. You each win Gryffindor five points. Professor Dumbledore will be informed of this. You may go." 
3331 
3332 They hurried out of the chamber and didn't speak at all until they had climbed two floors up. It was a relief to be away from the smell of the troll, quite apart from anything else. 
3333 
3334 "We should have gotten more than ten points," Ron grumbled. 
3335 
3336 "Five, you mean, once she's taken off Hermione's." 
3337 
3338 "Good of her to get us out of trouble like that," Ron admitted. "Mind you, we did save her." 
3339 
3340 "She might not have needed saving if we hadn't locked the thing in with her," Harry reminded him. 
3341 
3342 They had reached the portrait of the Fat Lady. 
3343 
3344 "Pig snout," they said and entered. 
3345 
3346 The common room was packed and noisy. Everyone was eating the food that had been sent up. Hermione, however, stood alone by the door, waiting for them. There was a very embarrassed pause. Then, none of them looking at each other, they all said "Thanks," and hurried off to get plates. 
3347 
3348 But from that moment on, Hermione Granger became their friend. There are some things you can't share without ending up liking each other, and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them. 
3349 
3350 CHAPTER ELEVEN 
3351 
3352 QUIDDITCH 
3353 
3354 As they entered November, the weather turned very cold. The mountains around the school became icy gray and the lake like chilled steel. Every morning the ground was covered in frost. Hagrid could be seen from the upstairs windows defrosting broomsticks on the Quidditch field, bundled up in a long moleskin overcoat, rabbit fur gloves, and enormous beaverskin boots. 
3355 
3356 The Quidditch season had begun. On Saturday, Harry would be playing in his first match after weeks of training: Gryffindor versus Slytherin. If Gryffindor won, they would move up into second place in the house championship. 
3357 
3358 Hardly anyone had seen Harry play because Wood had decided that, as their secret weapon, Harry should be kept, well, secret. But the news that he was playing Seeker had leaked out somehow, and Harry didn't know which was worse -- people telling him he'd be brilliant or people telling him they'd be running around underneath him holding a mattress. 
3359 
3360 It was really lucky that Harry now had Hermlone as a friend. He didn't know how he'd have gotten through all his homework without her, what with all the last-minute Quidditch practice Wood was making them do. She had also tent him Quidditch Through the Ages, which turned out to be a very interesting read. 
3361 
3362 Harry learned that there were seven hundred ways of committing a Quidditch foul and that all of them had happened during a World Cup match in 1473; that Seekers were usually the smallest and fastest players, and that most serious Quidditch accidents seemed to happen to them; that although people rarely died playing Quidditch, referees had been known to vanish and turn up months later in the Sahara Desert. 
3363 
3364 Hermione had become a bit more relaxed about breaking rules since Harry and Ron had saved her from the mountain troll, and she was much nicer for it. The day before Harry's first Quidditch match the three of them were out in the freezing courtyard during break, and she had conjured them up a bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar. 
3365 
3366 They were standing with their backs to it, getting warm, when Snape crossed the yard. Harry noticed at once that Snape was limping. Harry, Ron, and Hermione moved closer together to block the fire from view; they were sure it wouldn't be allowed. Unfortunately, something about their guilty faces caught Snape's eye. He limped over. He hadn't seen the fire, but he seemed to be looking for a reason to tell them off anyway. 
3367 
3368 "What's that you've got there, Potter?" 
3369 
3370 It was Quidditch Through the Ages. Harry showed him. 
3371 
3372 "Library books are not to be taken outside the school," said Snape. 
3373 
3374 "Give it to me. Five points from Gryffindor." 
3375 
3376 "He's just made that rule up," Harry muttered angrily as Snape limped away. "Wonder what's wrong with his leg?" 
3377 
3378 "Dunno, but I hope it's really hurting him," said Ron bitterly. 
3379 
3380 The Gryffindor common room was very noisy that evening. Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat together next to a window. Hermione was checking Harry and Ron's Charms homework for them. She would never let them copy ("How will you learn?"), but by asking her to read it through, they got the right answers anyway. 
3381 
3382 Harry felt restless. He wanted Quidditch Through the Ages back, to take his mind off his nerves about tomorrow. Why should he be afraid of Snape? Getting up, he told Ron and Hermione he was going to ask Snape if he could have it. 
3383 
3384 "Better you than me," they said together, but Harry had an idea that Snape wouldn't refuse if there were other teachers listening. 
3385 
3386 He made his way down to the staffroom and knocked. There was no answer. 
3387 
3388 He knocked again. Nothing. 
3389 
3390 Perhaps Snape had left the book in there? It was worth a try. He pushed the door ajar and peered inside -- and a horrible scene met his eyes. 
3391 
3392 Snape and Filch were inside, alone. Snape was holding his robes above his knees. One of his legs was bloody and mangled. Filch was handing Snape bandages. 
3393 
3394 "Blasted thing*," Snape was saying. "How are you supposed to keep your eyes on all three heads at once?" 
3395 
3396 Harry tried to shut the door quietly, but -- "POTTER!" 
3397 
3398 Snape's face was twisted with fury as he dropped his robes quickly to hide his leg. Harry gulped. 
3399 
3400 "I just wondered if I could have my book back." 
3401 
3402 "GET OUT! OUT!" 
3403 
3404 Harry left, before Snape could take any more points from Gryffindor. He sprinted back upstairs. 
3405 
3406 "Did you get it?" Ron asked as Harry joined them. "What's the matter?" 
3407 
3408 In a low whisper, Harry told them what he'd seen. 
3409 
3410 "You know what this means?" he finished breathlessly. "He tried to get past that three-headed dog at Halloween! That's where he was going when we saw him -- he's after whatever it's guarding! And Id bet my broomstick he let that troll in, to make a diversion!" 
3411 
3412 Hermione's eyes were wide. 
3413 
3414 "No -- he wouldn't, she said. "I know he's not very nice, but he wouldn't try and steal something Dumbledore was keeping safe." 
3415 
3416 "Honestly, Hermione, you think all teachers are saints or something," 
3417 
3418 snapped Ron. "I'm with Harry. I wouldn't put anything past Snape. But what's he after? What's that dog guarding?" 
3419 
3420 Harry went to bed with his head buzzing with the same question. Neville was snoring loudly, but Harry couldn't sleep. He tried to empty his mind -- he needed to sleep, he had to, he had his first Quidditch match in a few hours -- but the expression on Snape's face when Harry had seen his leg wasn't easy to forget. 
3421 
3422 The next morning dawned very bright and cold. The Great Hall was full of the delicious smell of fried sausages and the cheer ful chatter of everyone looking forward to a good Quidditch match. 
3423 
3424 "You've got to eat some breakfast." 
3425 
3426 "I don't want anything." 
3427 
3428 "Just a bit of toast," wheedled Hermione. 
3429 
3430 "I'm not hungry." 
3431 
3432 Harry felt terrible. In an hour's time he'd be walking onto the field. 
3433 
3434 "Harry, you need your strength," said Seamus Finnigan. "Seekers are always the ones who get clobbered by the other team." 
3435 
3436 "Thanks, Seamus," said Harry, watching Seamus pile ketchup on his sausages. 
3437 
3438 By eleven o'clock the whole school seemed to be out in the stands around the Quidditch pitch. Many students had binoculars. The seats might be raised high in the air, but it was still difficult to see what was going on sometimes. 
3439 
3440 Ron and Hermione joined Neville, Seamus, and Dean the West Ham fan up in the top row. As a surprise for Harry, they had painted a large banner on one of the sheets Scabbers had ruined. It said Potter for President, and Dean, who was good at drawing, had done a large Gryffindor lion underneath. Then Hermione had performed a tricky little charm so that the paint flashed different colors. 
3441 
3442 Meanwhile, in the locker room, Harry and the rest of the team were changing into their scarlet Quidditch robes (Slytherin would be playing in green). 
3443 
3444 Wood cleared his throat for silence. 
3445 
3446 "Okay, men," he said. 
3447 
3448 "And women," said Chaser Angelina Johnson. 
3449 
3450 "And women," Wood agreed. "This is it." 
3451 
3452 "The big one," said Fred Weasley. 
3453 
3454 "The one we've all been waiting for," said George. 
3455 
3456 "We know Oliver's speech by heart," Fred told Harry, "we were on the team last year." 
3457 
3458 "Shut up, you two," said Wood. "This is the best team Gryffindor's had in years. We're going to win. I know it." 
3459 
3460 He glared at them all as if to say, "Or else." 
3461 
3462 "Right. It's time. Good luck, all of you." 
3463 
3464 Harry followed Fred and George out of the locker room and, hoping his knees weren't going to give way, walked onto the field to loud cheers. 
3465 
3466 Madam Hooch was refereeing. She stood in the middle of the field waiting for the two teams, her broom in her hand. 
3467 
3468 "Now, I want a nice fair game, all of you," she said, once they were all gathered around her. Harry noticed that she seemed to be speaking particularly to the Slytherin Captain, Marcus Flint, a sixth year. Harry thought Flint looked as if he had some troll blood in him. Out of the corner of his eye he saw the fluttering banner high above, flashing Potter for President over the crowd. His heart skipped. He felt braver. 
3469 
3470 "Mount your brooms, please." 
3471 
3472 Harry clambered onto his Nimbus Two Thousand. 
3473 
3474 Madam Hooch gave a loud blast on her silver whistle. 
3475 
3476 Fifteen brooms rose up, high, high into the air. They were off. "And the Quaffle is taken immediately by Angelina Johnson of Gryffindor -- what an excellent Chaser that girl is, and rather attractive, too --" 
3477 
3478 "JORDAN!" 
3479 
3480 "Sorry, Professor." 
3481 
3482 The Weasley twins' friend, Lee Jordan, was doing the commentary for the match, closely watched by Professor McGonagall. 
3483 
3484 "And she's really belting along up there, a neat pass to Alicia Spinnet, a good find of Oliver Wood's, last year only a reserve -- back to Johnson and -- no, the Slytherins have taken the Quaffle, Slytherin Captain Marcus Flint gains the Quaffle and off he goes -- Flint flying like an eagle up there -- he's going to sc- no, stopped by an excellent move by Gryffindor Keeper Wood and the Gryffindors take the Quaffle -- that's Chaser Katie Bell of Gryffindor there, nice dive around Flint, off up the field and -- OUCH -- that must have hurt, hit in the back of the head by a Bludger -- Quaffle taken by the Slytherins -- that's Adrian Pucey speeding off toward the goal posts, but he's blocked by a second Bludger -- sent his way by Fred or George Weasley, can't tell which -- nice play by the Gryffindor Beater, anyway, and Johnson back in possession of the Quaffle, a clear field ahead and off she goes -- she's really flying -- dodges a speeding Bludger -- the goal posts are ahead -- come on, now, Angelina -- Keeper Bletchley dives -- misses -- GRYFFINDORS SCORE!" 
3485 
3486 Gryffindor cheers filled the cold air, with howls and moans from the Slytherins. 
3487 
3488 "Budge up there, move along." 
3489 
3490 "Hagrid!" 
3491 
3492 Ron and Hermione squeezed together to give Hagrid enough space to join them. 
3493 
3494 "Bin watchin' from me hut," said Hagrid, patting a large pair of binoculars around his neck, "But it isn't the same as bein' in the crowd. No sign of the Snitch yet, eh?" 
3495 
3496 "Nope," said Ron. "Harry hasn't had much to do yet." 
3497 
3498 "Kept outta trouble, though, that's somethin'," said Hagrid, raising his binoculars and peering skyward at the speck that was Harry. 
3499 
3500 Way up above them, Harry was gliding over the game, squinting about for some sign of the Snitch. This was part of his and Wood's game plan. 
3501 
3502 "Keep out of the way until you catch sight of the Snitch," Wood had said. "We don't want you attacked before you have to be." 
3503 
3504 When Angelina had scored, Harry had done a couple of loop-the-loops to let off his feelings. Now he was back to staring around for the Snitch. 
3505 
3506 Once he caught sight of a flash of gold, but it was just a reflection from one of the Weasleys' wristwatches, and once a Bludger decided to come pelting his way, more like a cannonball than anything, but Harry dodged it and Fred Weasley came chasing after it. 
3507 
3508 "All right there, Harry?" he had time to yell, as he beat the Bludger furiously toward Marcus Flint. 
3509 
3510 "Slytherin in possession," Lee Jordan was saying, "Chaser Pucey ducks two Bludgers, two Weasleys, and Chaser Bell, and speeds toward the -- wait a moment -- was that the Snitch?" 
3511 
3512 A murmur ran through the crowd as Adrian Pucey dropped the Quaffle, too busy looking over his shoulder at the flash of gold that had passed his left ear. 
3513 
3514 Harry saw it. In a great rush of excitement he dived downward after the streak of gold. Slytherin Seeker Terence Higgs had seen it, too. Neck and neck they hurtled toward the Snitch -all the Chasers seemed to have forgotten what they were supposed to be doing as they hung in midair to watch. 
3515 
3516 Harry was faster than Higgs -- he could see the little round ball, wings fluttering, darting up ahead - - he put on an extra spurt of speed -- WHAM! A roar of rage echoed from the Gryffindors below -- Marcus Flint had blocked Harry on purpose, and Harry's broom spun off course, Harry holding on for dear life. 
3517 
3518 "Foul!" screamed the Gryffindors. 
3519 
3520 Madam Hooch spoke angrily to Flint and then ordered a free shot at the goal posts for Gryffindor. But in all the confusion, of course, the Golden Snitch had disappeared from sight again. 
3521 
3522 Down in the stands, Dean Thomas was yelling, "Send him off, ref! Red card!" 
3523 
3524 "What are you talking about, Dean?" said Ron. 
3525 
3526 "Red card!" said Dean furiously. "In soccer you get shown the red card and you're out of the game!" 
3527 
3528 "But this isn't soccer, Dean," Ron reminded him. 
3529 
3530 Hagrid, however, was on Dean's side. 
3531 
3532 "They oughta change the rules. Flint coulda knocked Harry outta the air." 
3533 
3534 Lee Jordan was finding it difficult not to take sides. 
3535 
3536 "So -- after that obvious and disgusting bit of cheating "Jordan!" growled Professor McGonagall. 
3537 
3538 "I mean, after that open and revolting foul 'Jordan, I'm warning you --" 
3539 
3540 "All right, all right. Flint nearly kills the Gryffindor Seeker, which could happen to anyone, I'm sure, so a penalty to Gryffindor, taken by Spinner, who puts it away, no trouble, and we continue play, Gryffindor still in possession." 
3541 
3542 It was as Harry dodged another Bludger, which went spinning dangerously past his head, that it happened. His broom gave a sudden, frightening lurch. For a split second, he thought he was going to fall. He gripped the broom tightly with both his hands and knees. He'd never felt anything like that. 
3543 
3544 It happened again. It was as though the broom was trying to buck him off. But Nimbus Two Thousands did not suddenly decide to buck their riders off. Harry tried to turn back toward the Gryffindor goal- posts -- he had half a mind to ask Wood to call time-out -- and then he realized that his broom was completely out of his control. He couldn't turn it. He couldn't direct it at all. It was zigzagging through the air, and every now and then making violent swishing movements that almost unseated him. 
3545 
3546 Lee was still commentating. 
3547 
3548 "Slytherin in possession -- Flint with the Quaffle -- passes Spinnet -- passes Bell -- hit hard in the face by a Bludger, hope it broke his nose -- only joking, Professor -- Slytherins score -- A no... 
3549 
3550 The Slytherins were cheering. No one seemed to have noticed that Harry's broom was behaving strangely. It was carrying- him slowly higher, away from the game, jerking and twitching as it went. 
3551 
3552 "Dunno what Harry thinks he's doing," Hagrid mumbled. He stared through his binoculars. "If I didn' know better, I'd say he'd lost control of his broom... but he can't have...." 
3553 
3554 Suddenly, people were pointing up at Harry all over the stands. His broom had started to roll over and over, with him only just managing to hold on. Then the whole crowd gasped. Harry's broom had given a wild jerk and Harry swung off it. He was now dangling from it, holding on with only one hand. 
3555 
3556 "Did something happen to it when Flint blocked him?" Seamus whispered. 
3557 
3558 "Can't have," Hagrid said, his voice shaking. "Can't nothing interfere with a broomstick except powerful Dark magic -- no kid could do that to a Nimbus Two Thousand." 
3559 
3560 At these words, Hermione seized Hagrid's binoculars, but instead of looking up at Harry, she started looking frantically at the crowd. 
3561 
3562 "What are you doing?" moaned Ron, gray-faced. 
3563 
3564 "I knew it," Hermione gasped, "Snape -- look." 
3565 
3566 Ron grabbed the binoculars. Snape was in the middle of the stands opposite them. He had his eyes fixed on Harry and was muttering nonstop under his breath. 
3567 
3568 "He's doing something -- jinxing the broom," said Hermione. 
3569 
3570 "What should we do?" 
3571 
3572 "Leave it to me." 
3573 
3574 Before Ron could say another word, Hermione had disappeared. Ron turned the binoculars back on Harry. His broom was vibrating so hard, it was almost impossible for him to hang on much longer. The whole crowd was on its feet, watching, terrified, as the Weasleys flew up to try and pull Harry safely onto one of their brooms, but it was no good -- every time they got near him, the broom would jump higher still. They dropped lower and circled beneath him, obviously hoping to catch him if he fell. 
3575 
3576 Marcus Flint seized the Quaffle and scored five times without anyone noticing. 
3577 
3578 "Come on, Hermione," Ron muttered desperately. 
3579 
3580 Hermione had fought her way across to the stand where Snape stood, and was now racing along the row behind him; she didn't even stop to say sorry as she knocked Professor Quirrell headfirst into the row in front. 
3581 
3582 Reaching Snape, she crouched down, pulled out her wand, and whispered a few, well- chosen words. Bright blue flames shot from her wand onto the hem of Snape's robes. 
3583 
3584 It took perhaps thirty seconds for Snape to realize that he was on fire. 
3585 
3586 A sudden yelp told her she had done her job. Scooping the fire off him into a little jar in her pocket, she scrambled back along the row -- Snape would never know what had happened. 
3587 
3588 It was enough. Up in the air, Harry was suddenly able to clamber back on to his broom. 
3589 
3590 "Neville, you can look!" Ron said. Neville had been sobbing into Hagrid's jacket for the last five minutes. 
3591 
3592 Harry was speeding toward the ground when the crowd saw him clap his hand to his mouth as though he was about to be sick -- he hit the field on all fours -- coughed -- and something gold fell into his hand. 
3593 
3594 "I've got the Snitch!" he shouted, waving it above his head, and the game ended in complete confusion. 
3595 
3596 "He didn't catch it, he nearly swallowed it," Flint was still howling twenty minutes later, but it made no difference -- Harry hadn't broken any rules and Lee Jordan was still happily shouting the results -- Gryffindor had won by one hundred and seventy points to sixty. Harry heard none of this, though. He was being made a cup of strong tea back in Hagrid's hut, with Ron and Hermione. 
3597 
3598 "It was Snape," Ron was explaining, "Hermione and I saw him. He was cursing your broomstick, muttering, he wouldn't take his eyes off you." 
3599 
3600 "Rubbish," said Hagrid, who hadn't heard a word of what had gone on next to him in the stands. "Why would Snape do somethin' like that?" 
3601 
3602 Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another, wondering what to tell him. Harry decided on the truth. 
3603 
3604 "I found out something about him," he told Hagrid. "He tried to get past that three-headed dog on Halloween. It bit him. We think he was trying to steal whatever it's guarding." 
3605 
3606 Hagrid dropped the teapot. 
3607 
3608 "How do you know about Fluffy?" he said. 
3609 
3610 "Fluffy?" 
3611 
3612 "Yeah -- he's mine -- bought him off a Greek chappie I met in the pub las' year -- I lent him to Dumbledore to guard the "Yes?" said Harry eagerly. 
3613 
3614 "Now, don't ask me anymore," said Hagrid gruffly. "That's top secret, that is." 
3615 
3616 "But Snape's trying to steal it." 
3617 
3618 "Rubbish," said Hagrid again. "Snape's a Hogwarts teacher, he'd do nothin' of the sort." 
3619 
3620 "So why did he just try and kill Harry?" cried Hermione. 
3621 
3622 The afternoon's events certainly seemed to have changed her mind about Snape. 
3623 
3624 I know a jinx when I see one, Hagrid, I've read all about them! You've got to keep eye contact, and Snape wasn't blinking at all, I saw him!" 
3625 
3626 "I'm tellin' yeh, yer wrong!" said Hagrid hotly. "I don' know why Harry's broom acted like that, but Snape wouldn' try an' kill a student! Now, listen to me, all three of yeh -- yer meddlin' in things that don' concern yeh. It's dangerous. You forget that dog, an' you forget what it's guardin', that's between Professor Dumbledore an' Nicolas Flamel --" 
3627 
3628 "Aha!" said Harry, "so there's someone called Nicolas Flamel involved, is there?" 
3629 
3630 Hagrid looked furious with himself. 
3631 
3632 CHAPTER TWELVE 
3633 
3634 THE MIRROR OF ERISED 
3635 
3636 Christmas was coming. One morning in mid-December, Hogwarts woke to find itself covered in several feet of snow. The lake froze solid and the Weasley twins were punished for bewitching several snowballs so that they followed Quirrell around, bouncing off the back of his turban. The few owls that managed to battle their way through the stormy sky to deliver mail had to be nursed back to health by Hagrid before they could fly off again. 
3637 
3638 No one could wait for the holidays to start. While the Gryffindor common room and the Great Hall had roaring fires, the drafty corridors had become icy and a bitter wind rattled the windows in the classrooms. 
3639 
3640 Worst of all were Professor Snape's classes down in the dungeons, where their breath rose in a mist before them and they kept as close as possible to their hot cauldrons. 
3641 
3642 "I do feel so sorry," said Draco Malfoy, one Potions class, "for all those people who have to stay at Hogwarts for Christmas because they're not wanted at home." 
3643 
3644 He was looking over at Harry as he spoke. Crabbe and Goyle chuckled. 
3645 
3646 Harry, who was measuring out powdered spine of lionfish, ignored them. 
3647 
3648 Malfoy had been even more unpleasant than usual since the Quidditch match. Disgusted that the Slytherins had lost, he had tried to get everyone laughing at how a wide-mouthed tree frog would be replacing Harry as Seeker next. Then he'd realized that nobody found this funny, because they were all so impressed at the way Harry had managed to stay on his bucking broomstick. So Malfoy, jealous and angry, had gone back to taunting Harry about having no proper family. 
3649 
3650 It was true that Harry wasn't going back to Privet Drive for Christmas. 
3651 
3652 Professor McGonagall had come around the week before, making a list of students who would be staying for the holidays, and Harry had signed up at once. He didn't feel sorry for himself at all; this would probably be the best Christmas he'd ever had. Ron and his brothers were staying, too, because Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were going to Romania to visit Charlie. 
3653 
3654 When they left the dungeons at the end of Potions, they found a large fir tree blocking the corridor ahead. Two enormous feet sticking out at the bottom and a loud puffing sound told them that Hagrid was behind it. 
3655 
3656 "Hi, Hagrid, want any help?" Ron asked, sticking his head through the branches. 
3657 
3658 "Nah, I'm all right, thanks, Ron." 
3659 
3660 "Would you mind moving out of the way?" came Malfoys cold drawl from behind them. "Are you trying to earn some extra money, Weasley? Hoping to be gamekeeper yourself when you leave Hogwarts, I suppose -- that hut of Hagrid's must seem like a palace compared to what your family's used to." 
3661 
3662 Ron dived at Malfoy just as Snape came up the stairs. 
3663 
3664 "WEASLEY!" 
3665 
3666 Ron let go of the front of Malfoy's robes. 
3667 
3668 "He was provoked, Professor Snape," said Hagrid, sticking his huge hairy face out from behind the tree. "Malfoy was insultin' his family." 
3669 
3670 "Be that as it may, fighting is against Hogwarts rules, Hagrid," said Snape silkily. "Five points from Gryffindor, Weasley, and be grateful it isn't more. Move along, all of you." 
3671 
3672 Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle pushed roughly past the tree, scattering needles everywhere and smirking. 
3673 
3674 "I'll get him," said Ron, grinding his teeth at Malfoy's back, "one of these days, I'll get him --" 
3675 
3676 "I hate them both," said Harry, "Malfoy and Snape." 
3677 
3678 "Come on, cheer up, it's nearly Christmas," said Hagrid. "Tell yeh what, come with me an' see the Great Hall, looks a treat." 
3679 
3680 So the three of them followed Hagrid and his tree off to -the Great Hall, where Professor McGonagall and Professor Flitwick were busy with the Christmas decorations. 
3681 
3682 "Ah, Hagrid, the last tree -- put it in the far corner, would you?" 
3683 
3684 The hall looked spectacular. Festoons of holly and mistletoe hung all around the walls, and no less than twelve towering Christmas trees stood around the room, some sparkling with tiny icicles, some glittering with hundreds of candles. 
3685 
3686 "How many days you got left until yer holidays?" Hagrid asked. 
3687 
3688 "Just one," said Hermione. "And that reminds me -Harry, Ron, we've got half an hour before lunch, we should be in the library." 
3689 
3690 "Oh yeah, you're right," said Ron, tearing his eyes away from Professor Flitwick, who had golden bubbles blossoming out of his wand and was trailing them over the branches of the new tree. 
3691 
3692 "The library?" said Hagrid, following them out of the hall. "Just before the holidays? Bit keen, aren't yeh?" 
3693 
3694 "Oh, we're not working," Harry told him brightly. "Ever since you mentioned Nicolas Flamel we've been trying to find out who he is." 
3695 
3696 "You what?" Hagrid looked shocked. "Listen here -- I've told yeh -- drop it. It's nothin' to you what that dog's guardin'." 
3697 
3698 "We just want to know who Nicolas Flamel is, that's all," said Hermione. 
3699 
3700 "Unless you'd like to tell us and save us the trouble?" Harry added. "We must've been through hundreds of books already and we can't find him anywhere -- just give us a hint -- I know I've read his name somewhere." 
3701 
3702 "I'm sayin' nothin, said Hagrid flatly. 
3703 
3704 "Just have to find out for ourselves, then," said Ron, and they left Hagrid looking disgruntled and hurried off to the library. 
3705 
3706 They had indeed been searching books for Flamel's name ever since Hagrid had let it slip, because how else were they going to find out what Snape was trying to steal? The trouble was, it was very hard to know where to begin, not knowing what Flamel might have done to get himself into a book. He wasn't in Great Wizards of the Twentieth Century, or Notable Magical Names of Our Time; he was missing, too, from Important Modern Magical Discoveries, and A Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry. And then, of course, there was the sheer size of the library; tens of thousands of books; thousands of shelves; hundreds of narrow rows. 
3707 
3708 Hermione took out a list of subjects and titles she had decided to search while Ron strode off down a row of books and started pulling them off the shelves at random. Harry wandered over to the Restricted Section. He had been wondering for a while if Flamel wasn't somewhere in there. Unfortunately, you needed a specially signed note from one of the teachers to look in any of the restricted books, and he knew he'd never get one. These were the books containing powerful Dark Magic never taught at Hogwarts, and only read by older students studying advanced Defense Against the Dark Arts. 
3709 
3710 "What are you looking for, boy?" 
3711 
3712 "Nothing," said Harry. 
3713 
3714 Madam Pince the librarian brandished a feather duster at him. 
3715 
3716 "You'd better get out, then. Go on -- out!" 
3717 
3718 Wishing he'd been a bit quicker at thinking up some story, Harry left the library. He, Ron, and Hermione had already agreed they'd better not ask Madam Pince where they could find Flamel. They were sure she'd be able to tell them, but they couldn't risk Snape hearing what they were up to. 
3719 
3720 Harry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other two had found anything, but he wasn't very hopeful. They had been looking for two weeks, after A, but as they only had odd moments between lessons it wasn't surprising they'd found nothing. What they really needed was a nice long search without Madam Pince breathing down their necks. 
3721 
3722 Five minutes later, Ron and Hermione joined him, shaking their heads. 
3723 
3724 They went off to lunch. 
3725 
3726 "You will keep looking while I'm away, won't you?" said Hermione. "And send me an owl if you find anything." 
3727 
3728 "And you could ask your parents if they know who Flamel is," said Ron. 
3729 
3730 "It'd be safe to ask them." 
3731 
3732 "Very safe, as they're both dentists," said Hermione. 
3733 
3734 Once the holidays had started, Ron and Harry were having too good a time to think much about Flamel. They had the dormitory to themselves and the common room was far emptier than usual, so they were able to get the good armchairs by the fire. They sat by the hour eating anything they could spear on a toasting fork -- bread, English muffins, marshmallows -- and plotting ways of getting Malfoy expelled, which were fun to talk about even if they wouldn't work. 
3735 
3736 Ron also started teaching Harry wizard chess. This was exactly like Muggle chess except that the figures were alive, which made it a lot like directing troops in battle. Ron's set was very old and battered. 
3737 
3738 Like everything else he owned, it had once belonged to someone else in his family -- in this case, his grandfather. However, old chessmen weren't a drawback at all. Ron knew them so well he never had trouble getting them to do what he wanted. 
3739 
3740 Harry played with chessmen Seamus Finnigan had lent him, and they didn't trust him at all. He wasn't a very good player yet and they kept shouting different bits of advice at him, which was confusing. "Don't send me there, can't you see his knight? Send him, we can afford to lose him." On Christmas Eve, Harry went to bed looking forward to the next day for the food and the fun, but not expecting any presents at all. 
3741 
3742 When he woke early in the morning, however, the first thing he saw was a small pile of packages at the foot of his bed. 
3743 
3744 "Merry Christmas," said Ron sleepily as Harry scrambled out of bed and pulled on his bathrobe. 
3745 
3746 "You, too," said Harry. "Will you look at this? I've got some presents!" 
3747 
3748 "What did you expect, turnips?" said Ron, turning to his own pile, which was a lot bigger than Harry's. 
3749 
3750 Harry picked up the top parcel. It was wrapped in thick brown paper and scrawled across it was To Harry, from Hagrid. Inside was a roughly cut wooden flute. Hagrid had obviously whittled it himself. Harry blew it -- it sounded a bit like an owl. 
3751 
3752 A second, very small parcel contained a note. 
3753 
3754 We received your message and enclose your Christmas present. From Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia. Taped to the note was a fifty-pence piece. 
3755 
3756 "That's friendly," said Harry. 
3757 
3758 Ron was fascinated by the fifty pence. 
3759 
3760 "Weird!" he said, 'NMat a shape! This is money?" 
3761 
3762 "You can keep it," said Harry, laughing at how pleased Ron was. "Hagrid and my aunt and uncle -- so who sent these?" 
3763 
3764 "I think I know who that one's from," said Ron, turning a bit pink and pointing to a very lumpy parcel. "My mom. I told her you didn't expect any presents and -- oh, no," he groaned, "she's made you a Weasley sweater." 
3765 
3766 Harry had torn open the parcel to find a thick, hand-knitted sweater in emerald green and a large box of homemade fudge. 
3767 
3768 "Every year she makes us a sweater," said Ron, unwrapping his own, "and mine's always maroon." 
3769 
3770 "That's really nice of her," said Harry, trying the fudge, which was very tasty. 
3771 
3772 His next present also contained candy -- a large box of Chocolate Frogs from Hermione. 
3773 
3774 This only left one parcel. Harry picked it up and felt it. It was very light. He unwrapped it. 
3775 
3776 Something fluid and silvery gray went slithering to the floor where it lay in gleaming folds. Ron gasped. 
3777 
3778 "I've heard of those," he said in a hushed voice, dropping the box of Every Flavor Beans he'd gotten from Hermione. "If that's what I think it is -- they're really rare, and really valuable." 
3779 
3780 "What is it?" 
3781 
3782 Harry picked the shining, silvery cloth off the floor. It was strange to the touch, like water woven into material. 
3783 
3784 "It's an invisibility cloak," said Ron, a look of awe on his face. "I'm sure it is -- try it on." 
3785 
3786 Harry threw the cloak around his shoulders and Ron gave a yell. 
3787 
3788 "It is! Look down!" 
3789 
3790 Harry looked down at his feet, but they were gone. He dashed to the mirror. Sure enough, his reflection looked back at him, just his head suspended in midair, his body completely invisible. He pulled the cloak over his head and his reflection vanished completely. 
3791 
3792 "There's a note!" said Ron suddenly. "A note fell out of it!" 
3793 
3794 Harry pulled off the cloak and seized the letter. Written in narrow, loopy writing he had never seen before were the following words: Your father left this in my possession before he died. It is time it was returned to you. Use it well. 
3795 
3796 A Very Merry Christmas to you. 
3797 
3798 There was no signature. Harry stared at the note. Ron was admiring the cloak. 
3799 
3800 "I'd give anything for one of these," he said. "Anything. What's the matter?" 
3801 
3802 "Nothing," said Harry. He felt very strange. Who had sent the cloak? Had it really once belonged to his father? Before he could say or think anything else, the dormitory door was flung open and Fred and George Weasley bounded in. Harry stuffed the cloak quickly out of sight. He didn't feel like sharing it with anyone else yet. 
3803 
3804 "Merry Christmas!" 
3805 
3806 "Hey, look -- Harry's got a Weasley sweater, too!" 
3807 
3808 Fred and George were wearing blue sweaters, one with a large yellow F on it, the other a G. 
3809 
3810 "Harry's is better than ours, though," said Fred, holding up Harry's sweater. "She obviously makes more of an effort if you're not family." 
3811 
3812 "Why aren't you wearing yours, Ron?" George demanded. "Come on, get it on, they're lovely and warm." 
3813 
3814 "I hate maroon," Ron moaned halfheartedly as he pulled it over his head. 
3815 
3816 "You haven't got a letter on yours," George observed. "I suppose she thinks you don't forget your name. But we're not stupid -- we know we're called Gred and Forge." 
3817 
3818 "What's all th is noise. 
3819 
3820 Percy Weasley stuck his head through the door, looking disapproving. He had clearly gotten halfway through unwrapping his presents as he, too, carried a lumpy sweater over his arm, which Fred seized. 
3821 
3822 "P for prefect! Get it on, Percy, come on, we're all wearing ours, even Harry got one." 
3823 
3824 "I -- don't -- want said Percy thickly, as the twins forced the sweater over his head, knocking his glasses askew. 
3825 
3826 "And you're not sitting with the prefects today, either," said George. "Christmas is a time for family." 
3827 
3828 They frog-marched Percy from the room, his arms pinned to his side by his sweater. 
3829 
3830 Harry had never in all his life had such a Christmas dinner. A hundred fat, roast turkeys; mountains of roast and boiled potatoes; platters of chipolatas; tureens of buttered peas, silver boats of thick, rich gravy and cranberry sauce -- and stacks of wizard crackers every few feet along the table. These fantastic party favors were nothing like the feeble Muggle ones the Dursleys usually bought, with their little plastic toys and their flimsy paper hats inside. Harry pulled a wizard cracker with Fred and it didn't just bang, it went off with a blast like a cannon and engulfed them all in a cloud of blue smoke, while from the inside exploded a rear admiral's hat and several live, white mice. Up at the High Table, Dumbledore had swapped his pointed wizard's hat for a flowered bonnet, and was chuckling merrily at a joke Professor Flitwick had just read him. 
3831 
3832 Flaming Christmas puddings followed the turkey. Percy nearly broke his teeth on a silver sickle embedded in his slice. Harry watched Hagrid getting redder and redder in the face as he called for more wine, finally kissing Professor McGonagall on the cheek, who, to Harry's amazement, giggled and blushed, her top hat lopsided. 
3833 
3834 When Harry finally left the table, he was laden down with a stack of things out of the crackers, including a pack of nonexplodable, luminous balloons, a Grow-Your-Own-Warts kit, and his own new wizard chess set. 
3835 
3836 The white mice had disappeared and Harry had a nasty feeling they were going to end up as Mrs. Norris's Christmas dinner. 
3837 
3838 Harry and the Weasleys spent a happy afternoon having a furious snowball fight on the grounds. Then, cold, wet, and gasping for breath, they returned to the fire in the Gryffindor common room, where Harry broke in his new chess set by losing spectacularly to Ron. He suspected he wouldn't have lost so badly if Percy hadn't tried to help him so much. 
3839 
3840 After a meal of turkey sandwiches, crumpets, trifle, and Christmas cake, everyone felt too full and sleepy to do much before bed except sit and watch Percy chase Fred and George all over Gryffindor tower because they'd stolen his prefect badge. 
3841 
3842 It had been Harry's best Christmas day ever. Yet something had been nagging at the back of his mind all day. Not until he climbed into bed was he free to think about it: the invisibility cloak and whoever had sent it. 
3843 
3844 Ron, full of turkey and cake and with nothing mysterious to bother him, fell asleep almost as soon as he'd drawn the curtains of his four-poster. Harry leaned over the side of his own bed and pulled the cloak out from under it. 
3845 
3846 His father's... this had been his father's. He let the material flow over his hands, smoother than silk, light as air. Use it well, the note had said. 
3847 
3848 He had to try it, now. He slipped out of bed and wrapped the cloak around himself. Looking down at his legs, he saw only moonlight and shadows. It was a very funny feeling. 
3849 
3850 Use it well. 
3851 
3852 Suddenly, Harry felt wide-awake. The whole of Hogwarts was open to him in this cloak. Excitement flooded through him as he stood there in the dark and silence. He could go anywhere in this, anywhere, and Filch would never know. 
3853 
3854 Ron grunted in his sleep. Should Harry wake him? Something held him back -- his father's cloak -- he felt that this time -- the first time -- he wanted to use it alone. 
3855 
3856 He crept out of the dormitory, down the stairs, across the common room, and climbed through the portrait hole. 
3857 
3858 "Who's there?" squawked the Fat Lady. Harry said nothing. He walked quickly down the corridor. 
3859 
3860 Where should he go? He stopped, his heart racing, and thought. And then it came to him. The Restricted Section in the library. He'd be able to read as long as he liked, as long as it took to find out who Flamel was. 
3861 
3862 He set off, drawing the invisibility cloak tight around him as he walked. 
3863 
3864 The library was pitch-black and very eerie. Harry lit a lamp to see his way along the rows of books. The lamp looked as if it was floating along in midair, and even though Harry could feel his arm supporting it, the sight gave him the creeps. 
3865 
3866 The Restricted Section was right at the back of the library. Step ping carefully over the rope that separated these books from the rest of the library, he held up his lamp to read the titles. 
3867 
3868 They didn't tell him much. Their peeling, faded gold letters spelled words in languages Harry couldn't understand. Some had no title at all. 
3869 
3870 One book had a dark stain on it that looked horribly like blood. The hairs on the back of Harry's neck prickled. Maybe he was imagining it, maybe not, but he thought a faint whispering was coming from the books, as though they knew someone was there who shouldn't be. 
3871 
3872 He had to start somewhere. Setting the lamp down carefully on the floor, he looked along the bottom shelf for an interestinglooking book. A large black and silver volume caught his eye. He pulled it out with difficulty, because it was very heavy, and, balancing it on his knee, let it fall open. 
3873 
3874 A piercing, bloodcurdling shriek split the silence -- the book was screaming! Harry snapped it shut, but the shriek went on and on, one high, unbroken, earsplitting note. He stumbled backward and knocked over his lamp, which went out at once. Panicking, he heard footsteps coming down the corridor outside -- stuffing the shrieking book back on the shelf, he ran for it. He passed Filch in the doorway; Filch's pale, wild eyes looked straight through him, and Harry slipped under Filch's outstretched arm and streaked off up the corridor, the book's shrieks still ringing in his ears. 
3875 
3876 He came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of armor. He had been so busy getting away from the library, he hadn't paid attention to where he was going. Perhaps because it was dark, he didn't recognize where he was at all. There was a suit of armor near the kitchens, he knew, but he must be five floors above there. 
3877 
3878 "You asked me to come directly to you, Professor, if anyone was wandering around at night, and somebody's been in the library Restricted Section." 
3879 
3880 Harry felt the blood drain out of his face. Wherever he was, Filch must know a shortcut, because his soft, greasy voice was getting nearer, and to his horror, it was Snape who replied, "The Restricted Section? Well, they can't be far, we'll catch them." 
3881 
3882 Harry stood rooted to the spot as Filch and Snape came around the corner ahead. They couldn't see him, of course, but it was a narrow corridor and if they came much nearer they'd knock right into him -- the cloak didn't stop him from being solid. 
3883 
3884 He backed away as quietly as he could. A door stood ajar to his left. It was his only hope. He squeezed through it, holding his breath, trying not to move it, and to his relief he managed to get inside the room without their noticing anything. They walked straight past, and Harry leaned against the wall, breathing deeply, listening to their footsteps dying away. That had been close, very close. It was a few seconds before he noticed anything about the room he had hidden in. 
3885 
3886 It looked like an unused classroom. The dark shapes of desks and chairs were piled against the walls, and there was an upturned wastepaper basket -- but propped against the wall facing him was something that didn't look as if it belonged there, something that looked as if someone had just put it there to keep it out of the way. 
3887 
3888 It was a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, with an ornate gold frame, standing on two clawed feet. There was an inscription carved around the top: Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi. His panic fading now that there was no sound of Filch and Snape, Harry moved nearer to the mirror, wanting to look at himself but see no reflection again. He stepped in front of it. 
3889 
3890 He had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself from screaming. He whirled around. His heart was pounding far more furiously than when the book had screamed -- for he had seen not only himself in the mirror, but a whole crowd of people standing right behind him. 
3891 
3892 But the room was empty. Breathing very fast, he turned slowly back to the mirror. 
3893 
3894 There he was, reflected in it, white and scared-looking, and there, reflected behind him, were at least ten others. Harry looked over his shoulder -- but still, no one was there. Or were they all invisible, too? Was he in fact in a room full of invisible people and this mirror's trick was that it reflected them, invisible or not? He looked in the mirror again. A woman standing right behind his reflection was smiling at him and waving. He reached out a hand and felt the air behind him. If she was really there, he'd touch her, their reflections were so close together, but he felt only air -- she and the others existed only in the mirror. 
3895 
3896 She was a very pretty woman. She had dark red hair and her eyes -- her eyes are just like mine, Harry thought, edging a little closer to the glass. Bright green -- exactly the same shape, but then he noticed that she was crying; smiling, but crying at the same time. The tall, thin, black-haired man standing next to her put his arm around her. He wore glasses, and his hair was very untidy. It stuck up at the back, just as Harry's did. 
3897 
3898 Harry was so close to the mirror now that his nose was nearly touching that of his reflection. 
3899 
3900 "Mom?" he whispered. "Dad?" 
3901 
3902 They just looked at him, smiling. And slowly, Harry looked into the faces of the other people in the mirror, and saw other pairs of green eyes like his, other noses like his, even a little old man who looked as though he had Harry's knobbly knees -- Harry was looking at his family, for the first time in his life. 
3903 
3904 The Potters smiled and waved at Harry and he stared hungrily back at them, his hands pressed flat against the glass as though he was hoping to fall right through it and reach them. He had a powerful kind of ache inside him, half joy, half terrible sadness. 
3905 
3906 How long he stood there, he didn't know. The reflections did not fade and he looked and looked until a distant noise brought him back to his senses. He couldn't stay here, he had to find his way back to bed. He tore his eyes away from his mother's face, whispered, "I'll come back," 
3907 
3908 and hurried from the room. 
3909 
3910 "You could have woken me up," said Ron, crossly. 
3911 
3912 "You can come tonight, I'm going back, I want to show you the mirror. 
3913 
3914 "I'd like to see your mom and dad," Ron said eagerly. 
3915 
3916 "And I want to see all your family, all the Weasleys, you'll be able to show me your other brothers and everyone." 
3917 
3918 "You can see them any old time," said Ron. "Just come round my house this summer. Anyway, maybe it only shows dead people. Shame about not finding Flamel, though. Have some bacon or something, why aren't you eating anything?" 
3919 
3920 Harry couldn't eat. He had seen his parents and would be seeing them again tonight. He had almost forgotten about Flamel. It didn't seem very important anymore. Who cared what the three headed dog was guarding? What did it matter if Snape stole it, really? "Are you all right?" said Ron. "You look odd." 
3921 
3922 What Harry feared most was that he might not be able to find the mirror room again. With Ron covered in the cloak, too, they had to walk much more slowly the next night. They tried retracing Harry's route from the library, wandering around the dark passageways for nearly an hour. 
3923 
3924 "I'm freezing," said Ron. "Let's forget it and go back." 
3925 
3926 "No!" Harry hissed. I know it's here somewhere." 
3927 
3928 They passed the ghost of a tall witch gliding in the opposite direction, but saw no one else. just as Ron started moaning that his feet were dead with cold, Harry spotted the suit of armor. 
3929 
3930 "It's here -- just here -- yes!" 
3931 
3932 They pushed the door open. Harry dropped the cloak from around his shoulders and ran to the mirror. 
3933 
3934 There they were. His mother and father beamed at the sight of him. 
3935 
3936 "See?" Harry whispered. 
3937 
3938 "I can't see anything." 
3939 
3940 "Look! Look at them all... there are loads of them...." 
3941 
3942 "I can only see you." 
3943 
3944 "Look in it properly, go on, stand where I am." 
3945 
3946 Harry stepped aside, but with Ron in front of the mirror, he couldn't see his family anymore, just Ron in his paisley pajamas. 
3947 
3948 Ron, though, was staring transfixed at his image. 
3949 
3950 "Look at me!" he said. 
3951 
3952 "Can you see all your family standing around you?" 
3953 
3954 "No -- I'm alone -- but I'm different -- I look older -- and I'm head boy!" 
3955 
3956 "What?" 
3957 
3958 "I am -- I'm wearing the badge like Bill used to -- and I'm holding the house cup and the Quidditch cup -- I'm Quidditch captain, too. 
3959 
3960 Ron tore his eyes away from this splendid sight to look excitedly at Harry. 
3961 
3962 "Do you think this mirror shows the future?" 
3963 
3964 "How can it? All my family are dead -- let me have another look --" 
3965 
3966 "You had it to yourself all last night, give me a bit more time." 
3967 
3968 "You're only holding the Quidditch cup, what's interesting about that? I want to see my parents." 
3969 
3970 "Don't push me --" 
3971 
3972 A sudden noise outside in the corridor put an end to their discussion. 
3973 
3974 They hadn't realized how loudly they had been talking. 
3975 
3976 "Quick!" 
3977 
3978 Ron threw the cloak back over them as the luminous eyes of Mrs. Norris came round the door. Ron and Harry stood quite still, both thinking the same thing -- did the cloak work on cats? After what seemed an age, she turned and left. 
3979 
3980 "This isn't safe -- she might have gone for Filch, I bet she heard us. 
3981 
3982 Come on." 
3983 
3984 And Ron pulled Harry out of the room. 
3985 
3986 The snow still hadn't melted the next morning. 
3987 
3988 "Want to play chess, Harry?" said Ron. 
3989 
3990 "No." 
3991 
3992 "Why don't we go down and visit Hagrid?" 
3993 
3994 "No... you go..." 
3995 
3996 "I know what you're thinking about, Harry, that mirror. Don't go back tonight." 
3997 
3998 "Why not?" 
3999 
4000 "I dunno, I've just got a bad feeling about it -- and anyway, you've had too many close shaves already. Filch, Snape, and Mrs. Norris are wandering around. So what if they can't see you? What if they walk into you? What if you knock something over?" 
4001 
4002 "You sound like Hermione." 
4003 
4004 "I'm serious, Harry, don't go." 
4005 
4006 But Harry only had one thought in his head, which was to get back in front of the mirror, and Ron wasn't going to stop him. 
4007 
4008 That third night he found his way more quickly than before. He was walking so fast he knew he was making more noise than was wise, but he didn't meet anyone. 
4009 
4010 And there were his mother and father smiling at him again, and one of his grandfathers nodding happily. Harry sank down to sit on the floor in front of the mirror. There was nothing to stop him from staying here all night with his family. Nothing at all. 
4011 
4012 Except -- "So -- back again, Harry?" 
4013 
4014 Harry felt as though his insides had turned to ice. He looked behind him. Sitting on one of the desks by the wall was none other than Albus Dumbledore. Harry must have walked straight past him, so desperate to get to the mirror he hadn't noticed him. 
4015 
4016 " -- I didn't see you, sir." 
4017 
4018 "Strange how nearsighted being invisible can make you," said Dumbledore, and Harry was relieved to see that he was smiling. 
4019 
4020 "So," said Dumbledore, slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with Harry, "you, like hundreds before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised." 
4021 
4022 "I didn't know it was called that, Sir." 
4023 
4024 "But I expect you've realized by now what it does?" 
4025 
4026 "It -- well -- it shows me my family --" 
4027 
4028 "And it showed your friend Ron himself as head boy."
